3.5 Litter Quality in Broiler House
Litter quality directly affects the health of the bird. Lower moisture levels in the litter help to 
reduce respiratory stress by reducing the amount of ammonia in the atmosphere. Good quality 
litter will also reduce the incidence of foot pad dermatitis.
With suitable management, health and environmental practices, the following nutritional 
strategies will help to maintain good litter quality:
 Avoid excessive levels of Crude Protein in diets.
 Avoid high salt/sodium levels, as this will increase bird water intake and cause wet 
litter.
 Avoid using poorly digestible or high fiber feed ingredients in the diets.
 Provide good-quality feed fats/oils in the diet, as this helps avoid enteric disorders 
which produce wet litter.
3.6 How to Improve Feed Efficiency on a Broiler Farm
The efficiency of feed utilization is a very important factor for consideration by a poultry farmer 
that wishes to stay in business. The following measures should therefore be taken to improve 
efficiency for feed utilization by flock managers
- Reduce feed spillage by attendants during feeding.
- Provide well design feeders with ―lips‖.
- Do not fill feeders more than ½ full.
- Control rats, as they contaminate and waste feeds.
- Ensure that the feeders are hung such that the levels of the feeder should be about.
 level with the back of the hens.
- In a given flock, provide adequate feeding space such that at least 75% of the 
 birds must be able to feed at once.
3.7 Water Supply
A chicken consumes two to three times as much water as the feed it consumes. Therefore, when 
water supply to the flock is restricted, feed intake drops and consequently egg production

declines. It is therefore essential to provide all poultry flocks with fresh, cool and clean water at 
all times (Ad libitum). 
 - Provide adequate number of drinkers of correct sizes for the age of the flock.
 - Wash drinkers daily.
 - Serve fresh cool water and clean the drinkers at least twice a day – mornings and 
evenings.
 - Place drinkers on raised platforms to minimize water wastage and contamination.
Floor Spacing
The following space requirement is recommended for broiler
Space Requirement
a. Day-old to three weeks 9.14 cm/chick
b. 3 weeks to 4 weeks 15.24 cm/chick
c. 5 weeks to Market Age 30.48 cm/bird
Feeding Space
a. Day-old to 4 weeks 2.5 cm/bird
b. 4 weeks to 8 weeks 5 to 6.5 cm/bird
Watering Space
a. Day-old to 4 weeks 0.5 cm/bird or two 3.79L drinking fountains/100 birds
b. 4 weeks to 8 weeks 0.6 to 1 cm/bird or two 7.57L drinking fountains/100 birds
3.8 Housing Systems
Broilers can be housed on deep-litter, slatted or wire floor or cages. However, cage, slat and 
wire floor rearing of broilers are not as popular as litter floor rearing, due to problems like breast 
blisters, leg weakness and higher initial investment.
Rearing systems
The systems of rearing refer to either single batch at a time (all-in all-out system) or multiple 
batches of brooding and rearing of broilers.
