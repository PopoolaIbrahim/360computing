<h1>Tilapia Farming</h1>
<img src="images29.jpeg" style="width: 400;height:400;">

<br>
Tilapia fish farming is a good and lucrative business. It is new in Nigeria and the demand in the country is on the rise with few farmers exploring this venture.
<br><br>
Tilapia fish farming is becoming more popular because Tilapia is easier to raise compared to most fish breeds and it is highly resistant to diseases. Tilapia can survive in diverse temperature conditions and feeds on vegetable.  Hence, tilapia farmers will make profit because any product from the farmer will be mopped up.
<br><br>
<h3>Setting up a Tilapia farm:</h3>

Nigeria has extremely good conditions to encourage tilapia production due to its favorable weather conditions all year round thus Nigerians can venture into tilapia farming. Before establishing a tilapia farm, the following must be considered before you start up a tilapia fish farm in Nigeria.
<br>
 

<h3>Source of water:</h3>

A regular and accessible source of water is important to set up a tilapia farm. The water should be of favorable pH and temperature of about 28 degrees Celsius. The location of the farm should be free from flooding.  
<br>
<h3>Environmental condition:</h3>

Tilapia lives in water, thus, the physical and chemical constituent of the water affects the fish either positively or adversely. To achieve maximum yield, the water should be between 28 to 30 degrees Celsius. The pH level of the water should be suitable for the survival of the fish. Substances that can pollute the farm should be cleared out and the farm should be kept free of predators.
<br>
 

<h3>Choice of fingerling:</h3>

There are four common breeds of Tilapia. Oreochromis is the most common specie of tilapia fish but Blue Tilapia has the fastest growth rate. A farmer can buy tilapia fingerlings and raise them until they attain a required size before they are sold or he can breed his own stock.
<br>
<br>
 
<h3>Pond Construction:</h3>

Tilapia fish can be reared artificially in a pond. These are cheaper to construct for farmers and tilapia production specialists. A pond should be able to hold water and allow natural biological activities occur thereby providing the conditions necessary for optimal production. Also, a properly constructed and managed pond, gives a good yield and vice versa. Hence, the farmer should pay good attention to construct an ideal pond for his fishes. When constructing an artificial pond, ensure that its depth allows water to flow into it. The floor of the pond should be surging. An ideal pond floor should be made of clay or concrete with compost and have a pH level of 7 or 8. There should be an inlet for water and a channel to drain it when necessary.
