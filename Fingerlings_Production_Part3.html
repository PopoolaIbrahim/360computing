<h2> Injection of brood-stock</h2>

There are different hormones available that can be used to induce ovulation in gravid broodstockexamples are ovatide, ovaprim etc. 0.5ml is usually given per kg of fish. Before administering the injection the head of fish is covered with a towel to reduce agitation. The injection should be inserted at an angle of 30 to 45 in the dorsal muscle in the direction of the tail (Plate 4) the hormone is injected intramuscularly while retracting the syringe, this is followed by gently rubbing of the area with finger to allow even distribution of the hormone. The fish is then returned to the prepared receptacle where it will be left for about 10 to 12 hours before stripping.

<h2>Fertilization of eggs</h2>

On to the eggs collected in the plastic bowl the sperm cells in the testes is evenly distributed on the eggs mass and this is followed immediately by addition of saline solution (0.9%) to enhance motility of the sperm cells and fertilization of the eggs. Fertilization is completed when clean water is added to the eggs and sperm cells; the water is also used to rinse eggs off the milt before incubation (Plate 7).

<h2>Plate 7: Fertilization of eggs</h2>

<h2> Incubation of fertilized eggs</h2>

After fertilization it is expected that the fertilized eggs are incubated in an incubating unit provided. The eggs are evenly spread on the spawning mat and a constant water flow of rate of about 1 to 3 lit/min is allowed to flow through in the incubating unit. Depending on water temperature the eggs will hatch at about 20 to 24 hours. Incubation should be monitored at regular interval to check overflow of water and subsequent loss of hatchlings (Plate 8).

<h2>Rearing of hatchlings/larvae</h2>

The hatchlings are small and needle like with light green coloured globe yolk sac, at this stage feeding is not required until about three days after absorption of the yolk (Plate 9). It is required that the shell and the aborted eggs removed by careful siphoning to prevent contamination predisposing the hatchling to infection by bacteria and fungi. Aeration is very necessary as fry are very active and require a lot of oxygen but where aeration is not available constant water flow is very important as this will not only aerate but also remove feaces and uneaten food which can easily contaminate the water. Active feeding commence soon after absorption of yolk at this time artemia or other fry feed available can be given to the fry for about 2 to 3 weeks which is then followed by formulated feed with at least about 40 to 45% crude protein. This feed is given until they reach fingerling stage i.e. 6-8 weeks old.
