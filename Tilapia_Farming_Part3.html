<h3>Harvesting:</h3>

The fish can be harvested individually using hooks or by hand or they can be harvested collectively by either using nets or draining the pond.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Disease control and Treatment:</h3>

To prevent the outbreak of disease in the pond, it should be cleaned regularly. Its water should be changed immediately it gets dirty and the population of the fish should be checked to prevent overcrowding. Again, any new fish that is being introduced should be quarantined to prevent infection. In case of a disease outbreak, changing the water is essential. Seek veterinary assistance immediately.
 <br>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

Tilapias are the second most popular fishes used in Nigerian meals and this aquaculture business has great potential for sustainable income. However, it also requires a proper feasibility study of the fish farming business by estimating the size of your potential market, cost of farm products, and other essential factors.
