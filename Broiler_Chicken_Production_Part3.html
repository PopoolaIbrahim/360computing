3.10 MARKETING
A proper market survey is essential as that will enable the farmer to identify the current and 
emerging markets where broiler mean can be sold at a better price.
Marketing activities include among other value adding, grading, quality, promotions and 
packaging. A proper utilisation of these activities is essential as that will lead to selling large 
volumes of products as quickly as possible resulting in the farmer making a lot of profit.
Value Adding: In broiler production, processes that need to be performed within the business 
aimed to add value to the product before selling are: slaughtering, cutting chicken portions, 
grading, weighing and packaging. It is advisable that farmers process their meat products within 
the business and before selling, because the product will attract better prices than relatively 
unprocessed meat.
Quality. The final performance of broiler meat in the market depends on the quality of the 
chicks. Therefore, farmers should provide the flock with proper feeding, good ventilated houses 
and proper handling during the growth stage to ensure good quality meat. It is important for 
farmers to ensure that chickens are always alert, have uniform weight and no deformities on 
placement which are results of good management practices. In addition; chicken should be sold 
when it is still fresh from that farm, or after culling
Promotions: Advertising is essential for the success and growth of any Poultry business as it 
will help farmers to identify and attract potential customers as well as build good relationship 
with them. Therefore, farmers should promote broiler products well so that they make them 
appear to be different from others and that will increase the demand for their broiler products
Packaging: Packaging is important, not necessarily for protecting the product but for the 
profitability of poultry business. Targeted packaging will increase sales.

4.0 CONCLUSION
Broilers birds are fast growing birds; they are ready for the market at about 8 weeks. Broilers are 
usually reared on Deep Litter. The birds are fed either Broiler Starter or Broiler Finisher Feed 
depending on their age. Eighty percent of the energy content of the feed is obtained from Grains 
(Maize). To increase productivity feed utilisation by the birds must be enhanced, water must be 
supplied Ad-libitum and litter properly managed.
