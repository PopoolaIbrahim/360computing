3	Choosing a site 
3.1	General considerations 
Snails are adept at escaping from enclosures. A priority in setting up a productive snail farming venture, therefore, is to construct escapeproof housing. There are several types of snail housing (snaileries) to choose from, depending on the size of the venture; see Chapter 4. The first step, however, is to select an appropriate site. 
The main factors to consider in site selection are the following: 
? (Micro)climate 
? Wind speed and direction 
? Soil characteristics 
? Safety, protecting the snails from diseases, predators and poachers 
Optimal site selection helps to prevent, or at least reduce, dormancy (see section 2.6). Factors such as temperature and humidity and soil characteristics that influence snail survival and growth are discussed below. 
3.2	Temperature and humidity 
Snails are cold-blooded; they thrive best in areas with moderate temperatures and high humidity. In West Africa, temperatures in the areas where most edible species are found do not fluctuate greatly. However, there are significant fluctuations in air humidity, which have a pronounced effect on the GALS species dealt with in this publication. In their natural surroundings, snails go into dormancy during the dry season (see section 2.6 and Figure 6). 
Relative air humidity should not be near saturation, because it would encourage the development of harmful bacteria and fungi. 
In outdoor situations, it is clearly impossible to control climatic factors. However, the magnitude of temperature and humidity fluctua-
Choosing a site 
tions is reduced in areas of relatively undisturbed forest or fairly dense vegetation cover. Such sites should be preferred to open grassland or farmland areas. 
Obviously, snails can be reared in a completely controlled, indoor environment, but at a price. Whether the investment will be profitable depends on one's financial resources, local production costs per kg snail meat, and marketing options. 
3.3	Wind speed and direction 
Wind accelerates moisture loss in snails. To prevent snails from drying out, snaileries should be situated in sites that are protected from the wind. Downhill sites are usually the most suitable, preferably those with good tree cover to reduce wind impact. Planting (fruit) trees around snail pens will help to reduce wind speed and improve the micro-climate. It will also protect the snails from scorching sun or torrential rain. 
  
Figure 7: General view of an open free-range snail pen, with multistorey tree cover acting as a windbreak and reducing loss of water from the soil. 
3.4	Soil characteristics 
Soil is a major part of a snail's habitat. Soil composition, water content and texture are important factors to consider in site selection. 
? The snail's shell is made up mainly of calcium derived from the soil and from feed. 
? Snails derive most of their water requirements from the soil. 
? Snails dig in the soil to lay their eggs and to rest during the dry season. 
For all these reasons it is essential that the soil is loose and that its calcium and water content is high. 
? Heavy, clayey soil that becomes waterlogged in the rainy season and compacts during the dry season is undesirable. 
? Very sandy soil is undesirable as well because of its low waterholding capacity. 
? Acidic soils should be avoided because acidity would interfere with the development of the snail’s shell. Soils that are too acidic might be neutralised with lime to about pH 7. 
? Soils with high organic matter support the growth and development of snails. In general, if a soil supports good growth of cocoyam, tomatoes and leafy vegetables, it is suitable for snail farming. 
? Before introducing snails to the site, the soil should be loosened by tilling. 
? Snails need damp, not wet, environments. Although snails need moisture, you must drain wet or waterlogged soil. Similarly, rainwater must run off promptly. Snails breathe air and may drown in overly wet surroundings. A soil moisture content of 80% of field capacity is favourable. In the hours of darkness, air humidity over 80% will promote good snail activity and growth. 
Most snail activity, including feeding, occurs at night, with peak activity taking place 2 to 3 hours after the onset of darkness. The cooler temperature stimulates activity, and the night-time dew helps the snail move easily. Snails like to hide in sheltered places during most of the 
Choosing a site 
day. In Nigeria, shredded semi-dry banana leaves are put in the snail pens for the snails to hide under during daytime. 
To maintain adequate humidity and moisture levels in drier locations, misting sprayers can be used (like those used for plant propagation) − if technically and economically feasible. 
Snail shells are 97-98% calcium carbonate, therefore calcium must be available to them, either from the soil or from an external source (ground limestone, egg shells and so on, see Chapter 5). Organic matter in the soil is as important as carbonates. Soils that are rich in exchangeable calcium and magnesium stimulate growth best. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. 
Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favours snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may result in fragile shells even if the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails’ growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails often eat feed, then eat dirt. Sometimes, they eat only one or the other. 
Eventually the soil in the snail pens will become fouled with mucus and droppings. Chemical changes may also occur. The soil must, therefore, be changed once every three months (see Chapter 6). 
 
4	Constructing a snailery 
4.1	Choosing a system: the options 
The type and dimensions of your snailery or snaileries depend, obviously, on the snail growing system you choose, and on the quantity of snails you intend to produce. 
As far is housing is concerned, your snail farm could be extensive, semi-intensive, or intensive, in increasing order of complexity, management and financial inputs. Three options might be considered: 
? Extensive system: outdoor, free-range snail pens. 
? Mixed, or semi-intensive system: egg laying and hatching occur in a controlled environment; the young snails are then removed after 6-8 weeks to outside pens for growing or fattening or both. 
? Intensive: closed systems, for example plastic tunnel houses, greenhouses and buildings with controlled climate. 
 (Note: the same options of extensive, semi-intensive, or intensive apply to feed and feeding, see Chapter 5). 
Regardless of the size and type of your snail farm, the housing system must meet the following conditions. It must be: 
? escape-proof; snails are master-escapists and unless prevented from doing so they will quickly wander all over your (or your neighbour's) garden or house. 
? spacious, in accordance with the growing stage of the snails (hatchlings, juveniles, breeding snails, or mature snails fattened for consumption). Snails suffer from overcrowding, which impedes their development and increases the risk of diseases. Suitable rearing densities range from > 100/m2 for hatchlings to 7-10/m2 for breeding snails (see Chapter 6). 
? easily accessible and easy to work in or with, for handling the snails, placing feed, cleaning and other tasks. 
? well-protected from insects, predators and poachers. 
Different materials can be used for building snaileries, depending on  price and availability. 
? Decay- and termite-resistant timber. In West Africa favourable tree species are iroko (Milicia excelsa, local name – odum), opepe (Naucleadiderrichii, local name – kusia), or ekki (Lophira alata, local name – kaku). In South East Asia poles can be made of a species like teak (Tectona grandis), which is widely planted in other continents as well. 
? Sandcrete blocks, or mudbricks. 
? Galvanized sheets, polythene sheets. 
? Chicken wire, for protection. 
? Mosquito nets or nylon mesh, for covering the pens as protection against insects. 
? Second-hand materials, like car tyres, oil drums and old water tanks. 
In addition to car tyres, oil drums and such materials, the following types of pens might be considered for simple snaileries: 
? Hutch boxes 
? Trench pens 
? Mini-paddock pens 
? Free-range pens 
4.2	Car tyres, oil drums 
Discarded tyres or oil drums may serve as relatively cheap snail pens. Three or four tyres are placed on top of each other, with chicken wire and mosquito mesh between the topmost tyre and the second one from the top. 
Oil drums should have some holes in the bottom for drainage, be filled with good soil to a depth of 7-10 cm, and be fitted with wire plus mosquito mesh on top. 
Such pens are suitable for keeping a few snails (up to about four mature snails in each container) close to the house, for private use. 
4.3	Hutch boxes 
Description 
Hutch boxes are square or rectangular, single or multi-chamber wooden boxes with lids, placed on wooden stilts above the ground at a suitable height for easy handling. The stilts should be fitted with plastic or metal conical protectors or aprons, to prevent vermin from crawling or climbing up the stilts to attack the snails in the boxes. The protectors could be made from old tins or plastic bottles. In the middle of the lid is an opening covered with wire netting and nylon mesh. The lid should be fitted with a padlock to discourage pilfering. In the floor of the box are a few holes through which excess water can drain out. The boxes are filled with sieved black soil to a depth of 18-25 cm. The box(es) should obviously be well protected from scorching sun or torrential rain. 
Application and use 
Hutch boxes are useful in a semi-intensive snail breeding system. They are very suitable as hatchery and nursery pens because eggs and young snails can be easily located and observed. 
  
Figure 8: Snails in one of the chambers of a hutch box 
Mature snails in larger snaileries could be transferred to hutch boxes when they start making holes to lay eggs. The breeding snails should be removed to their own pens after the hatchlings start to emerge. 
The soil must be changed occasionally because an accumulation of droppings will increase the chances of disease development. A soil change every three months is adequate. 
Advantages and disadvantages 
Hutch boxes can be placed close to the farmer's house, ensuring good supervision and protection. They are built at a comfortable working height, which facilitates feeding and handling of the snails. 
Disadvantages are the cost of construction and their limited size, which restricts the number of snails that can be kept in them (some 30 hatchlings/juveniles, or about three mature snails in a box of the size shown in Figure 9). The procedure for building a hutch box is shown in the same Figure 9. 
4.4	Trench pens 
Description 
Trench pens are adjoining snail pens of  0.6 × 0.6 m to 1 × 1 m, either dug into the ground (which must be very well-drained), or raised 4050 cm above the ground. Outside walls and inner partitions consist of sandcrete blocks or mudbricks in either case. See Figure 10 (dug trench pen and raised trench pen). 
The pens are filled with suitable soil to a depth of 10-15 cm. They are covered with wooden or steel frame lids with chicken wire plus nylon mesh, and fitted with padlocks to discourage poachers. Obviously the pens must be protected against the fierce heat of the sun or heavy rain. Shredded semi-dry banana leaves may be spread in the pens to provide shelter for the snails (see Figure 10, inset). 
  
Figure 9: Sequence of building a single chamber hutch box 
  
Figure 10: Two types of trench pens: A: dug in, B: raised. The inset shows Archachatina marginata snail crawling around in shredded banana leaves (for dimensions see Appendix 2). 
Application and use 
Trench pens are suitable in semi-intensive to intensive snail growing ventures. They can be used as hatchery, nursery or fattening pens,  with the number of stock being adapted to the size of the snails in each case. The snails can be moved from one pen to another according to the growing cycle. 
Advantages and disadvantages 
The main advantage of a trench pen system, whether sunken or raised above the ground, is its flexibility. Snails can be moved around easily, in accordance with their size and phase in the growing cycle. The snails are always easy to locate, for feeding, handling, selection and final sale or consumption. 
The main disadvantages of trench pens are (a) construction costs  (specifically of raised pens, see figure 10), and (b) the fact that the farmer has to stoop or kneel down to tend the snails. 
4.5	Mini-paddock pens 
Description 
Mini-paddock pens are small square or rectangular pens, usually within a larger fenced area. They are built of bamboo and nylon mesh as in figure 11, or of timber, chicken wire and nylon mesh as in figure 12.  
  
Figure 11: Sequence of building a mini-paddock pen using bamboo and nylon mesh 
The walls should be some 50 cm high and be dug at least 20 cm into the ground. Wooden frames are attached to the top of the walls (extended inwards) and covered with the mesh, to prevent snails from escaping (see figure 11 and figure 12). Plants providing shelter and/or food are planted in the pens before snails are released into them. Suitable plants include cocoyam, sweet potato, fluted pumpkin, and leafy vegetables. Rectangular pens allow the farmer easier access to the whole area without having to enter the pens. Mini-paddock pens may also be constructed higher above ground, with a completely enclosed frame, and may even be roofed. 
  
Figure 12: A mini-paddock pen built of timber, wire netting and nylon mesh 
Application and use 
Mini-paddock pens, like free-range pens (see  section 4.6), are suitable as fattening pens, where snails that are no longer needed for breeding are allowed to put on weight before being collected for consumption or sale. Additional snail food may be placed in the pen, but uneaten food must be removed regularly. Food and shelter plants must be replanted from time to time. 
Advantages and disadvantages 
The advantage of mini-paddock pens is that snails grow in an environment resembling their natural habitat without much additional effort from the farmer. The limited dimensions of the pen still permit close supervision. 
The main disadvantage would seem to be that the snails are not protected against predators, unless the pen is entirely closed and roofed, which makes it more expensive. 
4.6	Free-range pens 
Description 
Essentially, free-range pens are large mini-paddock pens: a fenced area of up to 10 × 20 m, planted with plants, shrubs and trees that provide food and shelter from wind, sun and rain (see Figure 13). Just like in a mini-paddock pen, the vertical fence must be extended inwards, to prevent snails from escaping. If the fence is constructed of fine chicken wire mesh, the overhang is not obligatory because snails dislike crawling on wire mesh. The fence must be dug at least 20 cm into the ground. The free-range pen might even be completely enclosed and roofed. 
Application and use 
Free-range pens may serve as the sole snail enclosure in an extensive snail farming system, or as growing and fattening pens in a semiintensive one. 
In the extensive snail farm the entire life cycle of the snail develops within the open pen: mating, egg laying, hatching, hatchling development, and growth of the snails to maturity. Snails feed on the plants provided in the pen. 
In a semi-intensive snail farm the free-range pen serves as a growing and fattening pen for adult snails, which were raised through the egghatchling-juvenile stages in hutch boxes or trench pens. 
  
Figure 13: Completely enclosed free-range pen on concrete slab with drains. Note shade trees and palms around, and palm fronds on top to provide shade. 
Advantages and disadvantages 
In an extensive system using a free-range pen the snails develop in a near-normal habitat. They will take shelter in the vegetation or the soil during the day, coming out at night to feed. 
A simple fenced free-range pen is relatively simple and cheap to construct. Management is restricted to occasional replanting of food and shelter plants. If the vegetation within the pen is kept in shape, additional feeding of the snails is not necessary. 
A fully enclosed and roofed pen is quite costly to build, obviously, especially if provided with a concrete apron and drain (Figure 13). Both types require the availability of land with a secure title, considering the investment involved, specifically for the fully enclosed and roofed variety. 
  
Figure 14: Small-sized free-range snail pen in a city courtyard 
The free-range pen has several disadvantages. 
? It requires more land than other types of snail farming. 
? It is difficult to locate and protect eggs and small snails. This may lead to poor disease management and higher mortality compared to other snail production systems. 
? It is difficult to keep track of snail performance and, for that reason, to keep useful records of inputs and output. 
? In the open type of free-range pen it is more difficult to keep out predators and poachers. 
Besides the natural shelter provided in mini-paddock and free-range pens, it is advisable to also provide other forms of shelter to ensure that the snails are not exposed to too much heat. For example, concave tiles or split bamboo can be placed on stones on the ground, with the concave side facing downwards. On very hot days, the soil can be cooled by sprinkling water on it. 
More on rearing density and optimal pen size in relation to the stocking density of snails in their different growing stages can be found in section 6.3. 
The materials needed for different types of snaileries are listed in Appendix 2. 
 
5	Food and feeding 
5.1	Introduction 
The distinction between extensive, semi-intensive and intensive snail farming systems applies not only to housing (Chapter 4), but also to feeding. 
In an extensive system snails feed only on vegetation planted in their pens specifically for that purpose, as in mini-paddock and free-range pens. 
In a semi-intensive snail farm, external feed is provided to hatchlings, juveniles and possibly to breeding snails housed in hutch boxes or trench pens. 
In an intensively managed snail farm, all snails, at whatever growing stage, are always provided with external feed. Snails are kept in hutch boxes or trench pens. 
In very intensive farms the snails are fed a formulated snail feed mix containing all the proteins, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins required for optimal growth. Snails are housed in boxes or trench pens. 
Unless your snail farm is of the very extensive type, you will have to provide your snails with some or all the food they need for good development. This will require efforts on your part in growing or collecting snail food, or cash for buying it. Therefore, you must know what snails eat and what they need. 
5.2	Types of snail food 
What snails eat 
Snails are vegetarian and will accept many types of food. All snails will avoid plants that have hairy leaves or produce toxic chemicals, like physic nut (Jathropa curcas). Young snails prefer tender leaves and shoots; they consume about twice as much feed as mature snails. As they get older, mature snails increasingly feed on detritus: fallen leaves, rotten fruit and humus. Older snails should be fed the same items as immature snails. If a change in the diet has to be made, the new food items should be introduced gradually. 
What snails need 
Snails need carbohydrates for energy, and protein for growth. In addition they require calcium (Ca) for their shells, as well as other minerals and vitamins. Snail meat is low in crude fibre and fat; for that reason, these components are of minor importance in snail feed. 
 
Recommended food items 
Leaves: cocoyam, kola, paw paw, cassava, okra, eggplant, loofa, centrosema, cabbage and lettuce. Paw paw leaves (as well as its fruit and fruit peels) stand out in many trials as good snail food. 
Fruits: paw paw, mango, banana, eggplant, pear, oil palm, fig, tomato and cucumber. Fruits are usually rich in minerals and vitamins, but low in protein. 
Tubers: cocoyam, cassava, yam, sweet potato and plantain. Tubers are a good source of carbohydrates, though low in protein. (Cassava should be the low-cyanide type). 
Flowers: oprono (Mansonia altissima), odwuma (Musanga cecropoides) and paw paw. 
Household waste: peels of fruit and tuber, like banana, plantain, pineapple, yam and 
  
Figure 15: Snail food:  flowers and fruit 
  
Figure 16: Snail food: 
tubers 
 
especially paw paw, and leftovers like cooked rice, beans, fufu and eko. Caution: household waste must not contain salt! 
5.3	Recommendations on natural feed 
Market waste 
Because snails are vegetarians, the cheapest way to feed them is by collecting rejected but recommended food from marketplaces. At the end of any market day, some perishable vegetables and fruits still useful for snail consumption can be collected from the dumping areas. This would reduce the cost and labour of buying or cultivating vegetables and fruits only to feed snails. 
Achatina achatina 
Achatina achatina feeds mainly on green leaves, fruits, tubers and flowers. Unlike other snails, it prefers leaves and fruits that are detached from the main plant. It also seems to prefer wet leaves to dry ones and appears to thrive on prunings of food plants grown in pens. 
Providing A. achatina with a mixture of foods, rather than only one or two items, will enhance its growth. Food attractiveness is important in the nutrition of this species. If the food is appetising (e.g. paw paw) or contains a feeding stimulant, the snails will eat a lot and grow quickly. If food is unattractive or lacks a stimulant, however nutritious it may be, the snails will not eat much of it. 
A. achatina baby snails thrive best on leafy vegetables. At all other stages, a diet made up of the following ingredients is recommended: 
? Cocoyam. Cocoyam leaves contribute fairly high amounts of protein (2.9%), calcium (60 mg/kg) and phosphorus (52 mg/kg), and moderate amounts of thiamine (vitamin B 1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2). 
? Paw paw fruit provides moderate amounts of carbohydrates and high amounts of ascorbic acid (which is a feeding stimulant for many plant-eating animals, including snails). 
? Oil palm. The mesocarp (fleshy layer) of the oil palm is high in carbohydrates, fats and palmitate (vitamin A). 
? Supplementary vitamins. Other food plants known to contain moderate amounts of vitamins D, E and K should be added; examples are sunflower and copra cake (vitamin D), wheat germ, lettuce and other vegetables (vitamin E), cabbage and African spinach (vitamin K). 
? Supplementary calcium. If the soil is not high in calcium, supplementary calcium will be needed. This can be provided by sprinkling powdered oyster or snail shells or ground limestone onto leafy vegetables. 
? Supplementary minerals. Other minerals can be provided by placing licking stones containing the mineral in the pen. 
? Water. Clean water should be available to the snails at all times. 
  
Figure 17: Young A. achatina snails feeding on paw paw fruit 
Archachatina marginata 
Studies on Archachatina marginata show similar feeding demands, with paw paw leaves and fruits leading the list. Other common and nutritious feeds are okra, coco yam (Diascorea spp.), banana, cabbage, and even cassava leaves of the low cyanide variety. Younger snails are fed tender leaves. 
Summary recommendations on natural feed 
? Snails can feed on a large range of food items. 
? Looking for thrown-away surplus vegetables and fruits still consumable by snails is a good way to reduce feeding costs. 
? Feed containing waxy or hairy leaves should be avoided. Paw paw leaves, fruit and fruit peels stand out as excellent snail feed in many feeding trials. 
? Feeds should contain protein at a level of about 20% of diet dry matter for optimum development. Paw paw leaves, fruit and peels are a good source of crude protein. 
? For strong growth and good shell development, powdered calcium sources from egg shells, limestone, wood-ash, oyster shells (crushed), or bone meal, should be added to the feed at a level of about 15 to 20% of diet dry matter. Crushed oyster shell calcium is best. Increasing the amount of calcium above 20% of diet dry matter results in thicker shells, not in more snail meat. (Note: 20% Ca may seem like a lot, but remember this is a proportion of dry matter and customary snail feeds are made up mainly of water.) 
? Snails need water! Most is supplied by the food they consume, but additional water must be supplied in the growing pens: a watersoaked sponge or a dot of cotton wool for hatchlings and juveniles, in shallow dishes (otherwise the snails may drown) for mature and breeding snails. 
5.4	Recommendations on formulated feed 
As land pressures force people to move from extensive farming, in which natural foods are abundant, to semi-intensive farming, it may become necessary to introduce formulated feeds. Studies in Ghana in which poultry feed was used in snail farming showed that this formula has good potential in growing A. achatina. 
In Archachatina marginata snail farming in Nigeria, commercially formulated feeds are sometimes used, but they are rather expensive. You can mix a snail feed formula yourself, using the following ingredients and ratios (in kg per 100 kg mix; recipe from Nigeria): 
Table 1: A self-mix snail feed formula 
Ingredients 	kg 
Maize 	31.3 
Groundnut cake 	10 
Soy bean meal 	25 
Fish meal 	4 
Wheat offal 	16 
Palm kernel cake 	4.2 
Oyster shell 	8.05 
Bone meal 	1.2 
Premix vitamins & minerals 	0.25 
  
Figure 18: A self-mix snail feed formula 
In France, a compound feed commonly used for Helix species contains calcium, phosphorus, sodium chloride and vitamins A, B1, D, E and K. This sort of feed, formulated to meet the snail's specific nutritional requirements, has the effect of considerably reducing the growth period. Formulated food for H. aspersa, for example, reduced the growth period from hatching to harvest by 10 months, from 27 to 17 months. 
5.5	Feeding and growth 
Feeding management 
? Growth is highly dependent on ambient temperature and humidity. At high temperatures (> 30 °C) and relatively low air humidity (< c. 70%) growth slows down or stops, because snails go into dormancy. This should be avoided as much as possible, by good snail housing and management. 
? Optimum stocking density obviously depends on age and size of the snails. For hatchlings and juveniles stocking rates of 100/m2 or more are applied; for mature breeding snails stocking should not exceed 10-15 snails/m2. Overcrowding results in reduced growth and increased mortality! 
? How and when to feed snails. In their natural habitat snails are nocturnal animals, hiding during the day and coming out at night to feed. Their main feeding time starts from around two hours after sunset. For best results the snail farmer should not put snail feed in his pens before nightfall. Uneaten snail food should be removed from the pens daily; otherwise, it will attract vermin and/or diseases. To facilitate cleaning, the snail food might be placed on a flat dish, a concrete slab, or an oil drum lid, placed within the pen (figure 19). 
  
Figure 19: Concrete slab in Nigerian snail pen used for placing snail food. 
Snail growth 
It takes about 15 months for Achatina achatina to reach full maturity; so they are not fast-growing animals for the quantity of food they eat and the amount of consumable meat they produce. The other GAL species discussed in this booklet grow relatively slowly as well. Studies on diet and growth indicate growth rates from 5 to 20 g live weight per month, corresponding to about 2 to 8 g edible snail meat per month when the average dressing percentage of around 40% is considered (the remaining 60% of the snail’s weight is made up mostly of its shell, body fluid and intestines). 
An FAO brochure on snail breeding indicates that an annual production level of 12-13 kg edible snail meat ('escargot') can be expected from a 5 × 5m snailery of the free-range type (see Further Reading). 
Studies on the growth rate of snails (mainly Archachatina marginata in Nigeria) fed on different diets suggest that growth rates are influenced by the genetic make up of snails. Generally the offspring of the larger ecotypes grow faster. 
 
6	Breeding and management 
In extensive snail farming in free-range pens, the snails follow their natural life cycle. Interference from the snail farmer is restricted to the daily removal of any dead snails, refilling watering troughs, keeping the soil moist in the dry season, and occasionally harvesting mature snails for sale or for the cooking pot. 
In semi-intensive or intensive snail farming the farmer will actively manage the snails during the successive stages of their life cycle: egg laying, hatching, growing and maturity. Management activities proceed in tune with the snails' life cycle, which in turn follows the seasons with their periods of snail activity and of dormancy (aestivation during the dry seasons). (Note: Domesticated snails continue to lay eggs in the rainy and dry seasons; Omole et al., 2007). 
In either case, farmers must obtain breeding stock to start their snail farms. Snails might be obtained directly from the bush, from hawkers or markets, from other snail farmers, or from research institutes. 
6.1	Selecting breeding stock 
It is recommended to use sexually mature snails, weighing at least 100-125 g, as initial breeding stock. Farming should preferably start at the onset of the wet season, because that is the time snails normally start to breed. 
Until snail farms become self-sustaining, farmers may have to collect snails from the wild or buy them cheaply in the peak season and fatten them in captivity in the off season. In relatively undisturbed forest areas, snails can be collected on days following rains. Snails are active at night and on cloudy or foggy mornings. During the day they tend to keep well hidden, so it is best to collect them at night or early in the morning, when the sun is low and the humidity high. 
Farmers purchasing breeding stock from snail gatherers or from the market should expect a fairly high level of mortality as a result of poor handling and the adjustment to different foods. 
The most reliable way of obtaining parental stock is from known breeders, or from agricultural institutes. Such parent snails might be more expensive than snails from other sources, but they are better and safer because they have been properly fed and managed from hatching, and have not been damaged during collection and subsequent handling. 
Once the snail farm is established, farmers should select breeding stock from their own snails. Breeding stock must be selected in the wet season preceding aestivation, based on the following attributes: 
? Fecundity (expected number of eggs, based on numbers laid in previous seasons) 
? Hatchability (percentage of eggs likely to hatch out of the total number laid) 
? Establishment rate (percentage of snails likely to survive after  hatching) 
? Growth rate 
? Shell strength 
Simple records kept by snail farmers can provide the necessary information. As a general rule, the fastest growers with the strongest shells should be selected as breeding stock. The stronger its shell, the better the snail is protected against predators. 
6.2	Nursery 
Snails selected as breeding stock are placed in hutch boxes or trench pens, which must contain feed and water troughs. 
Some farmers let snails lay eggs in the grower pens, and then transfer the eggs to the nursery boxes or pens, but this is not recommended. It may be difficult to locate the eggs, and the eggs may be physically damaged during the transfer. 
A breeding snail may lay one to three egg masses (clutches) per season. The number of breeding snails placed in a hutch box depends on the fertility of the group and on the number of young snails required. The latter depends on the pen space available. After egg laying, the parent snails should be returned to their grower pens. 
In A. achatina, large differences have been observed in egg production within and between populations. The average size of egg mass produced by the various ecotypes studied in Ghana, for example, ranged from 38 to 563 eggs. Generally, snails lay between 100 and 400 eggs. The eggs are broadly oval and measure about 5 mm long. They are usually laid in round-shaped holes dug 2-5 cm deep in the soil (figure 20). Occasionally they are laid on the soil surface or at the base of plants. Snail eggs require a certain amount of warmth to induce hatching. They usually hatch 12-20 days after laying. 
  
Figure 20: Eggs laid in a hole dug in the soil 
In A. achatina, the baby snails have light-brown shells with black stripes. They should be kept in the boxes and fed on vegetable or fruit leaves (like cocoyam and paw paw leaves), fruits (preferably paw paw), powdered oyster shells and water until they are big enough to move to grower pens. Young snails do best if they are kept with snails of the same size. 
The eggs of Achatina fulica are small (4 mm) and are laid in clutches of 10 to 400; usually a parent snail lays several clutches in a year. Hatchlings remain 5-15 days underground before emerging. 
The eggs of Archachatina marginata are quite large (17 × 12 mm) and egg clutches are small (4-18 eggs). A parent snail may produce several clutches a year. The incubation period is around 4 weeks. Hatchlings remain underground for 2-5 days after hatching.
