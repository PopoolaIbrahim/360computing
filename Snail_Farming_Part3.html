6.3	Rearing density 
Density affects the growth and breeding capacity of snails. Highdensity populations tend to grow slowly, develop into smaller adults, and lay fewer clutches of eggs and fewer eggs per clutch. If the snails are very densely packed, they may not breed at all. The accumulating slime suppresses reproduction. Other disadvantages of high density are the high rates of parasitism and ease of transmission of diseases. 
In terms of snail weight, the recommended density is 1-1.5 kg per m2 (for A. achatina, this would be about 15 to 25 snails per square metre). It is best to start a snail farm with as low a density as possible. As the farmer becomes more familiar with snail habits and with managing the enterprise, the numbers could be increased. 
6.4	Seasonal and daily management  
As in any livestock farming operation, good management practices are the key to success. 
Most research on farming GALS has been carried out in West Africa. Seasonal activities, as described below, follow the march of the seasons of West Africa, with breeding and egg laying in March through July. Note that domesticated snails may continue laying during the dry season as well (Omole, et al. 2007). 
Snail breeders in other parts of the (sub)humid tropics should adapt the management cycle to local conditions. 
In semi-intensive or intensive snail farming, farmers keep and care for hatchlings, growers and breeding snails in separate hutch boxes or pens. 
Hatchlings 
Hatchlings require more humid conditions than adult snails. They should be fed tender leaves, such as paw paw and/or cocoyam, and a calcium supplement for good shell development. The soil in their pens should be kept moist and enough water should be provided. The pens should be fitted with small gauze wire mesh or nylon mesh; otherwise the small snails will escape. Hatchlings and juveniles may be kept at a density of around 100/m2. 
Growers 
Growers should be transferred to separate pens at around 3 months of age, at a stocking density of 30-40 snails/m2. For fast growth, they might be given compound feed, rich in crude protein, calcium and phosphorus, besides their normal diet. 
Breeders 
Breeders start to lay eggs at sexual maturity, at the age of 10 to 12 months. They should be transferred to boxes or pens at a density of 10-15 snails/m2. (Note: stocking densities mentioned are indications. The general stocking density guideline of 1-1.5 kg snail/m2 should always be kept in mind!) soil should be loosened to facilitate egg laying. The breeders' ration must be rich in crude protein and calcium. Any eggs found on the surface must be buried promptly to a depth of 1 to 2 cm. Before hatching, the soil on top of the clutches might be loosened or removed to facilitate uniform emergence. To avoid cannibalism, the breeders must be removed to their growing pens soon after the hatchlings emerge. Adults no longer required for breeding are kept in fattening pens until ready for sale or consumption. 
Daily management involves several activities: 
Feeding 
Snails should be fed after sunset. The feed must not be stale or mouldy. Leftovers should be removed the following morning. Water should be replenished. 
Housing 
Check whether wire mesh and mosquito netting are intact; repair where necessary. Clean the pens. Keep doors or covers of the snail pens closed and locked. 
Soil 
Keep the soil moist by mulching and watering if necessary in the dry season. Never add fresh poultry droppings to the soil. Change soil in the cages every three months. 
Hygiene 
Check pens for any dead snails; remove them immediately. Do not use insecticides or herbicides in your snailery. Handle your snails carefully and wash them with water from time to time. 
Recording 
Record inputs and output of your snail farm daily. Include your own labour or that of family members, and inputs, like food or repairs to the pens. 
6.5	Snail farming tools and equipment 
Besides the customary gardening tools (shovel, hoe, rake, cutlass, broom), the following equipment and tools are needed in successful snail farming: 
? small weighing scale, for weighing snails and feed 
? measuring tape, for measuring  pens and  snails 
? hand trowel, for digging in and cleaning out the pens 
? water container and watering can, for keeping the soil moist and refilling water troughs 
? water and feeding troughs or dishes 
? most important: a notebook, for carefully recording inputs (e.g. labour, materials and feed) and output of the snail farming venture.  
7	Predators, parasites and diseases 
Snail farmers must be aware of several predators, parasites and diseases if mortality rates are to be kept to a minimum. Snails have many natural predators, including members of all major vertebrate groups, carnivorous snails, ground beetles, leeches and even predatory caterpillars. 
Humans also pose great dangers to snails in the wild. Pollution and destruction of habitats have caused the extinction of some snail species in recent years. Human poachers pose a great danger to farmgrown snails as well! 
7.1	Predators 
The major predators a snail farmer may have to deal with are field mice, rats and shrews, frogs and toads, thrushes, crows and domesticated birds such as ducks and turkeys, lizards and snakes, drilid and carabid beetles, and millipedes and centipedes. The frogs tend to take only the young snails, while the reptiles eat both eggs and snails of all ages. 
In areas with high bird predation, it is necessary to place cover nets over the pens. Keeping some of the other predators out may require building fences around the pens. The fences should be between 15 and 30 cm high and dug well into the ground  It is also advisable to set bait or traps outside the snail farm area. 
Leftover food should be removed daily from pens because some predators, particularly rats and field mice, are attracted by the uneaten food. These predators can decimate a farm in a few days. 
 
  
Figure 21: Some natural enemies of snails 
However, the main predators are humans looking for a nutritious meal at the snail farmer's expense. Snail farmers must introduce any legal measures they consider necessary to protect the farm against poachers. 
Predators, parasites and diseases 
7.2	Parasites 
In Ghanaian studies, the major parasite on snails was found to be a fly, Alluaudihella flavicornis. This species belongs to the same family as the housefly and the adult resembles the adult housefly. 
A. flavicornis lays 20-40 eggs in the snail shell or on the snail. The eggs hatch in about one week and the small, cream-coloured worms start feeding on or in the body tissue. They feed until the body is reduced to a putrefying mass, and then pupate within the shell. After a 10-day incubation period, the adults emerge. The best protection against these flies is to cover the pens with nylon mesh. 
  
Figure 22: The entire life cycle of Alluaudihella flavicornis, a parasite of Achatina achatina, takes 25-40 days. 
Ectoparasitic mites are sometimes found on the snails in hutch boxes. They seem to be secondary parasites, usually occurring on inactive snails. 
Some nematodes are known to attack European species of edible snails. However, there are no known reports of nematodes parasitising A. achatina. 
7.3	Diseases 
Little is known of the diseases which attack A. achatina in West Africa. As snail farming increases in popularity, more research will probably focus on this area. The main disease that has been reported to date is a fungal disease, spread through physical contact by the snails licking slime from each other's bodies. 
The two major diseases affecting European species may also affect African species, because the organisms that cause these diseases do occur in the natural range of A. achatina. The first is a bacterial disease, caused by Pseudomonas; it leads to intestinal infections that may spread rapidly amongst dense snail populations. The second disease is caused by the fungus Fusarium, which parasitises the eggs of Helix aspersa. The affected eggs turn reddish-brown and development stops. This disease is commonly referred to as 'rosy eggs disease'. 
Basic hygiene prevents the spread of diseases. Pens should be cleaned out regularly to remove excreta and uneaten food, as well as any other decaying matter that may serve as substrate for pathogenic organisms. It is also advisable to sterilise the soil in hutch boxes by steaming or heating every time they are being prepared for a new batch of egg clutches (i.e. when the breeders are transferred to the boxes for egg laying). 
Predators, parasites and diseases 
8	Processing and consumption of snail meat 
8.1	Processing 
Harvesting and storage 
The age and size at which snails should be collected from the snailery obviously depends on the farming objective: whether the snails are grown for personal use or for the market. Snails grown for personal use can be harvested according to the farmer’s needs; whereas customer preferences dictate the optimum size and consequently age of snails harvested for the market. Snails usually need to grow for at least one year to reach their proper size and weight. It is recommended to harvest snails by the time they reach two years, because after this age their rate of growth slows down. 
Snails are picked by hand, at nightfall, when they become active and are easier to find and collect. They need to be put carefully into a basket, box, crate or sack, to avoid damaging the shell, which would lower their market value. Never put more than 10 kg snails together in whatever storage receptacle you use, to avoid cracking or crushing the shells in the lower layers. 
Snails, whether for household consumption or for the market, can be stored safely for up to 6-8 weeks in a box or crate, if you do not want to collect them daily. First put a 5 cm layer of sawdust or finely cut corncob leaves on the bottom of the box; place over this a layer of snails, then another 3 cm layer of sawdust, and so on, ending with a covering layer. The box should be kept in a cool, shaded place, well protected from predators and poachers. 
Snails can be transported to the market in baskets, boxes or sacks, but always take care not to damage them by putting too many together or on top of each other (max. 10 kg). 
Processing 
Freshly gathered snails have just eaten (except if collected when aestivating or hibernating). They can be used directly, but all faeces and dirt must be removed in the kitchen. It is easier and more hygienic to have them defecate before use. Store them in a basket or sack in a cool, shaded place without food for four days, to enable them to discharge all aliments in their intestinal tract. They are now ready for washing, boiling and dressing. 
Washing 
Put snails in a bucket with water, adding some salt and a dash of vinegar. Lemon or lime juice can be used instead of vinegar. Soon, the snails will start to discharge their slime: a milky, whitish liquid. Throw away the water and repeat the washing procedure until the water remains clear. 
Boiling 
After washing, put snails into boiling water, again adding some salt and vinegar, or lime or lemon juice, and boil thoroughly for at least 5 minutes. Achatina fulica (but possibly the other GALS species as well) is reported to be an intermediate vector of the Rat Lungworm and other diseases potentially lethal to humans. Improperly cooked Achatina fulica meat may act as a major source of human infection in places where it is commonly eaten by people, such as Taiwan. Thorough boiling is essential! 
Dressing 
Extract the snail from its shell, draining off the body fluid or haemolymph (unless local recipes call for its use), remove the viscera (heart, stomach, kidney, liver, intestines) and cut off the head. The meat is now ready for boiling, stewing, frying or whatever cooking technique your local snail recipe book calls for. 
Processing and consumption of snail meat 
8.2	Consumption 
Composition and nutritive value 
The data provided below originate from Nigerian studies of the GALS species Archachatina marginata. It can only be assumed that the composition and nutritive value of the other two GALS species discussed in this Agrodok are more or less the same. 
Table 2: Approximate dressing percentage of Archachatina marginata 
Total live weight of snail 	100% 	 
meat 	c. 40% 	(the edible foot of the snail) 
shell 	c. 30% 	 
viscera 	c. 17% 	 
body fluid 	c. 13% 	(haemolymph) 
Table 3: Approximate carcass composition (including moisture) 
crude protein 	60->80% 	depending on diet of the snails 
fat 	1.3-1.7% 	 
ash 	1.3-1.4% 	 
 
As far as protein is concerned, snail meat compares well with traditional sources of protein like chicken meat, pork or beef. 
A Nigerian study on mineral composition of snail flesh showed that values of iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium and sodium were consistently high; while cobalt, lead and copper – indicators of dangerous pollution – were not detected. Snail meat complements the minor and trace elements required for proper growth and development in humans, so it is recommended for regular consumption. 
Palatability 
In Ghana Achatina achatina is considered the most prized species for consumption, followed by Archachatina marginata and Achatina fulica, in order of preference. 
Several sources mention Achatina fulica as being slightly inferior to the edible European snails because it is 'rubbery' and often 'swampy tasting'. However, when highly flavoured with garlic, chopped and stuffed into shells of the genuine escargot, most people eating the African snails are effectively deceived! 
On the other hand, a French website offers tinned Achatina fulica 'escargot' (around 10 g/snail, including shells – possibly to make them resemble the real escargot). Taiwanese sites offer tinned Achatina fulica snails for sale in Taiwan and China. The species is also sold as a local food source in Seoul, Korea. 
Some traditional recipes 
In Ghana snails are used to prepare a variety of dishes, including soups, sauces and kebab. The big snails (locally referred to as 'atope') are preferred for soups. These range in weight from 120 to 450 g. However, juvenile snails (referred to as 'nwawaa' in Ghana, weighing between 20 and 40 g) are preferred for sauces. 
The meat is removed from the shell and the tubular appendages attached to the mantle are cut off. The meat is washed repeatedly to remove slimy substances and dirt. It is then put in a saucepan, with enough water to cover it, and boiled. The water is then drained and the meat is washed a second time in cold water. Snail kebabs are prepared from spiced, boiled or fried snails. 
For preparing light soup (Ghana) and pepper soup (Nigeria), already cooked snail meat is added to a variety of meats (for example, beef, mutton or fish) and sliced onions, and then steamed for about 10-15 minutes. Water is added to the steamed meat and brought to the boil. A blended vegetable mixture (including peppers and tomatoes) and salt are added, and the mixture is cooked until it thickens slightly. The soup can be served with such foods as fufu, rice, kenkey (corn dough), yam and bread. Other soups, such as palm-nut soup, groundnut soup and cocoyam leaf soup (also known as 'green green' in Ghana), can be prepared similarly. 
Processing and consumption of snail meat 
For preparing sauces, the snail meat is washed with lime to remove the slime. It is then seasoned with garlic, a stock cube, salt and other spices and boiled for about 20 minutes or fried in oil. Sliced onions, peppers, tomato puree and herbs are fried and stock is added. The sauce is allowed to simmer over a low heat until smooth and thickened, stirring constantly. The fried snail meat is added and cooked gently on a low heat. This can be served with such foods as rice, yam, potatoes, plantain and kenkey (corn dough). 
Grilled spiced snails in palm oil (Gbarnga, Liberia) 
Ingredients: 800 g snails, palm oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoon chilli powder (or red pepper), parsley leaves. 
Preparation time 10 minutes; cooking time 15 minutes. 
Remove snails from their shell, thoroughly wash the cleaned meat* - taking care it does not contain any sand – and put on a plate. Sprinkle snails with the lemon juice and leave to marinate for 10 minutes. Sprinkle snails with chilli powder (or pepper) and spiced salt. Wrap in aluminium foil and put in preheated oven of 160 °C for 15 minutes. Put palm oil in a dish, add finely cut parsley and spiced salt. Serve snails with the oil. 
Fried snails in tomato-chilli sauce (Igbin, Nigeria) 
Ingredients: 800 g cleaned snails, 400 g tomatoes, 100 g onions, 3 tablespoons palm oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoon chilli powder (or red pepper), parsley leaves. 
Preparation time 10 minutes; cooking time 20 minutes. 
Thoroughly clean the snails with lemon juice* and put on a plate. 
Sprinkle with lemon juice and leave to marinate for a few minutes. 
Peel onions and wash tomatoes. 
Heat oil in a pan, add tomatoes and fry 5 minutes. Add onions, snails, chilli powder and spiced salt and fry 10 minutes. Add chopped parsley and fry 5 more minutes. Serve warm. 
* There are two ways to remove the snails' slime after shelling. Washing them with the water of fermented cassava is the 'traditional' manner. This removes the slime as well as any 'rubbery' or 'earthy' taste. The second, 'modern' way is washing with lemon juice. 
 
9	Markets 
9.1	Local markets 
In the high-altitude forest areas of West Africa, particularly in Ghana, Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire, snail meat forms a substantial part of the meat in the diet of the local people. Snails are gathered in the wild, packed into bags, wooden crates or baskets and transported to selling points along main roads or to urban centres. 
  
Figure 23: Types of containers used to transport snails to markets 
The most common species sold at the roadside in West Africa are snails, duikers, brush-tailed porcupines, hares and grasscutters. Snails and grasscutters fetch the highest market prices per kilogram. 
In urban areas, the gatherers may sell the snails directly to consumers or to wholesale traders or retailers. Snails can be smoked and stored for sale during the off season when prices are highest. 
Snail price differences between the wet and dry seasons are vividly illustrated by the results of a snail marketing study carried out in Southern Nigeria (Eze et al., 2006, see ‘Further Reading’), which are presented in table 4. 
The channel of distribution for snails was from producers and hunters to retailers and then to consumers, or from hunters directly to consumers. Snail marketing was found to be marginally efficient in both the wet and dry seasons, which may be attributable to problems  such as the nature of the source of supply, poor storability and excessive price. 
Table 4: Nigerian snail prices in the wet and the dry seasons (1 US 
$ = N127.50 in 2007) 
 	Wet season 	Dry season 
Snail marketing gross return 	N28,175 	N43,680 
Marketing costs 	N25,940 	N40,630 
Net return 	N  2,235 	N  3,050 
Marketing efficiency 	1.09 	1.08 
 
  
Figure 24: Woman selling snails  
A marketing study in South Benin (Sodjinou et al.) showed GALS marketing to be dominated by women. The marketing network comprised hunter-gatherers, wholesalers, and dealers. Gross margin was relatively low for wholesalers, higher for market salesmen and high for gatherers, which encourages snail gathering in the wild and thus may lead to the snails’ extinction. For that reason it is essential to get GALS-raising programmes off the ground. 
Snails may take up to two years to reach the size that meets local consumer preferences. The marketable size required for export is slightly smaller. 
In some areas of West Africa, snail meat has never been part of the local diet. In the predominantly Muslim northern areas of West Africa, snail meat is not consumed, for religious and cultural reasons. 
Snail products 
A Nigerian study showed the feasibility of using snail meal of  the giant African snail Archatina marginata as a partial fishmeal substitute in raising fish (Clarias gariepinus) (Oyelese, 2007), with a 60% snail meal/40% fishmeal mixture giving optimum results. The study puts the production cost of snail meal (oven-dried flesh including viscera) at N 250/kg versus N300/kg for fishmeal (1 US $ = N127.50 in 2007). Production costs of snail meal might be further reduced by promoting the active rearing and marketing of the species for its values as a fishmeal product, and supplier of protein and nutrients for humans. 
Underdeveloped or damaged snails may be fed to pigs. 
Shells are often cited as a potential additional source of income from snail breeding, more specifically their sale to souvenir shops. This is obviously a very limited market and it would be unwise to base profitability calculations of your snail farm on a niche market like snail shells as adornments or souvenirs. 
Crushed snail shells may be applied in chicken feed or in liming to improve the quality of acidic (fish pond) soils. However, do not forget that your snail feed must contain enough calcium to enable the snails to develop sturdy shells. 
Processed snail meat 
Fresh snail meat can be processed, for storage or marketing, in several ways: 
? At farm level, it can be smoke-dried for sale in the off season when prices are traditionally higher. 
? Snail meat can be frozen or canned, for sale to domestic or export markets. This type of processing requires investments on a scale that is (probably) beyond the means of the individual snail farmer, though it might be undertaken by strong, prosperous farmers' cooperatives. 
? On-farm processing of snail meat into locally well-received, tasty dishes, for sale at your own roadside shop or to nearby restaurants, may be another way of adding value to snail farm products. Obviously, you should abide by local sanitary regulations when starting and running a snail meal kitchen. 
9.2	Export markets 
France plays a central role in the growing international trade in snails. Some of the snails imported into France are processed and exported to other European countries or to North America, especially to the USA, which imports hundreds of millions of US dollars’ worth of snail meat annually. Other important markets are Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, Austria, Denmark and South Africa. 
Among the major suppliers to these markets are Greece, Turkey, Rumania, Algeria, Tunisia, as well as Taiwan, Thailand and China. Most countries supply the European snail species Helix aspersa, H. pomatia and H. lucorum, while the Asian countries supply Achatina fulica. The snails are supplied fresh, frozen or canned. The African species fetch about one third of the price of the European species. This is mainly because, compared to the European species, the meat of the African species is considered to be rather rubbery and the shell less suitable for presenting the final product. European consumers generally prefer snails served in the shell. 
However, studies by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the United Kingdom have shown that juvenile A. achatina snails are meatier and more tender than the more favoured European species. It is hoped that this finding will increase demand for the African species. For West African producers, this might mean not only a bigger market for their product but also reduced costs of production because of the shorter growing period required (for the snails to reach the size preferred by consumers). However, it will take some time before the long-standing prejudices in continental Europe against the African snail species are overcome. 
Export markets clearly offer opportunities, though the small-scale snail producer should not underestimate the difficulties, including import regulations, hygienic and health requirements. It would seem that the small, local snail farmer might participate in export opportunities best through farmers' cooperatives,  or by contract farming for large, local snail processing and export ventures.

Step 1: Plan 
Marketing plan: why do you want to farm snails? 
? Own consumption 
? Selling live snails to local market(s), local restaurants 
? Selling preserved (frozen, canned) snail meat on distant mar-              kets 
(Note: this Agrodok is not primarily intended for the snail grower for distant markets.) 
Production plan: 
Type of farming 
Part life cycle farming: young snails collected from the wild, bought from other breeders or agricultural institutes, then raised on the farm to table size. 
Complete life cycle farming: snails born and bred on the farm. (Note: complete life cycle farming is recommended, to prevent diseases from being introduced into your farm by snails from outside). Farm size: the size of your pilot snail farm will depend on your marketing plan. Nigerian experiments show optimal stocking density for 
 
the giant African snails to be 100 snails/ m2 for juveniles of 0.5-49 g, and 30/m2 for pre-adults of 50-100g. Optimum density for breeding (egg-laying) snails is much lower: 6-7/ m2. 
(Note: snail weight refers to the live snail, including the shell). 
Species 
This manual concentrates on GALS, giant African land snails: Achatina achatina (coastal West Africa), Archachatina marginata (Central African rainforest zone), and Achatina fulica (originally from East Africa, now widely dispersed throughout the world). Using the local species for farming is obviously preferable, keeping in mind that – at least in Ghana – A. achatina is considered the tastiest species for consumption, followed by Arch. marginata, and A. fulica, in order of preference. 
Organisation plan: 
? Family operation 
? Commercial venture, financially and organisationally separated from your farm. 
Step 2: Pilot production 
During the pilot production phase you should keep detailed records on which to base your go or no go decision to continue snail farming or stop. 
? records of inputs: labour (your own or household members, hired labour), money, materials, feed and so on 
? records of growth performance of your snails. 
Step 3: Go or no go decision 
Only after carefully balancing production costs (per marketable snail, or per kg live snail, or dressed snail meat) and sales revenue will you be able to start a snail growing venture safely. 
Appendix 1: Planning a snail farming venture - 5 steps 
Step 4: Investment in facilities and know-how 
Facilities: 
? Location, type and size of cages or pens, depending on the scale of snail farming planned. 
? Finance, corresponding to the scale of the snail farming operation: 
? Private or family capital, micro-credit (Grameen Bank model) or commercial credit. 
Know-how: 
? Acquiring or improving your knowledge of snail farming through exchange of information, reading, attending courses, etc. 
Step 5: Upscaling 
? Logistical control: careful recording and control of inputs (labour, materials, feed and medicines). 
? Quality control: growing and delivering healthy products (snails in this case). 
? Financial control: careful recording and control of inputs, output, and profits. 
Note: Points of attention under Step 5 apply to any farming operation.
