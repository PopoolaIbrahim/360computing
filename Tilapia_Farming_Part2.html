<h3>Feeding:</h3>

Feeding tilapia is quite easy because tilapias feed on almost all food sources and can thrive solely on pellets, the fish can also survive on very common substances like algae, fish feed, larvae, insects etc. Tilapia are typically fed moderate to high protein pelleted diets at rates ranging from 1.0% to 30% of their body weight per day depending upon their age and size. To prevent competition, ensure that the fishes have enough food. By providing essential nutrients to tilapia, you enable them grow faster and reach harvesting size as quickly as possible.
<br>
<h3>Breeding:</h3>

This involves multiplying the population of the tilapias in your pond to maximize profit.  There are four common breeds of Tilapia but the one with the fastest growth rate is the Blue Tilapia. Another breed with high growth rate is the Nile Tilapia.
<br><br>
However, it is worthy of note that female tilapia are very active in reproduction and can produce as much as 250 fingerlings in three weeks so caution should be taken to check over population. These include having more male tilapia in your pond, using hormones and using some specific breed. Again, the fingerlings should be placed in a different pond from the adults to prevent them from competing with the adults and growing better.
