Minerals 
Minerals are important in the diet to keep goats healthy. There are two 
groups of minerals. Macro mineral nutrients (major) are in relatively 
large amounts while micro minerals (minor) are needed in very small 
quantities. The minerals needed in goat diets are given below: 
Macro Mineral Micro Mineral 
Calcium Iodine Fluorine 
Phosphorus Copper Iron 
Potassium Cobalt Manganese 
Sodium Selenium Zinc
Chlorine Molybdenum Nickel 
Magnesium Sulphur

Some soils suffer from mineral deficiencies or have minerals that are not 
available to plants and so are not ingested by goats. Copper, cobalt and 
selenium are good examples. If goats receive insufficient copper they 
grow slowly and kids may be born unable to walk on their back legs. 
Giving copper to the nanny can prevent this condition, but care must be 
taken not to overdose, since this may lead to death from copper 
poisoning. The only exact way of knowing whether a goat is short of 
copper is to take a blood sample and have it analyzed. 
One method of giving copper is by an injection under the skin twice 
yearly. Alternatively, boluses can be given to the goat to swallow. These 
remain in the stomach and slowly release copper over a six-month 
easiest solution to most minor mineral deficiency problems is for goats 
to have access to a composite mineral lick. These can be purchased from 
feed companies or sometimes local rocks or salt blocks are available. In 
intensive systems minerals can be added to the concentrates feed. 
Selenium and cobalt can be added to the concentrates feed. Selenium 
and cobalt can be given as a liquid drench to counter any deficiency of 
these mineral. 
Calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) are important minerals in milk 
production and a lack of calcium in the diet may lead to milk fever in 
newly-kidded nannies. This condition can be fatal. As a guide 0.9g of Ca 
and P should be available per 1kg of milk produced.
Mineral toxicity or deficiencies are less commonly seen in an acute form 
than a chronic one. Copper deficiency, when most severe, will produce 
swayback in kids. Where the deficiency or toxicity is less severs, more 
chronic symptoms include: 
• scouring 
• poor fertility 
• hair loss 
• Poor appetite and growth.

Because these are also normal indications of poor nutrition and parasite 
infestation, identifying mineral deficiencies is difficult and best 
confirmed by the analysis of blood samples. 
Water 
All animal require access to water to enable them to perform normal 
body functions. This should ideally be fresh and clean. The more 
continuous the access the better the animal’s metabolism performs and 
the higher its production. In practical terms, however, watering animals 
usually takes place once or twice daily or even very other day. The 
amount of water needed by a goat depends upon: 
• Amount of dry matter eaten 
• Whether the goat is lactating 
• Air temperature 
• Drinking frequency 
• Water temperature. 
If goats eat succulent feeds, which have high moisture content, they 
need to drink less than they do when fed on dry feed. In desert 
conditions they will lick the dew from the trees. If water is cool or 
available at all times goats will drink less. In hot conditions goats keep 
cool by seeking shade under trees or rocks and will pant and sit when 
the air temperature exceeds 390
c. Panting causes loss of heat by 
evaporations of water from the lungs. Indigenous goats have a reputation 
for being very tolerant to heat stress and having a reduced demand for 
water. Long or shiny coats are thought to help protect the skin from the 
sun’s heat. Exotic breeds, on the other hand, are less adaptable and tend 
to eat less in hotter conditions which leads to body weight losses. 
Compared with sheep, goats pant less and lose less water in the faeces 
and urine. 
To achieve maximum efficiency, goats need to drink 4kg of water for 
every 1kg of dry matter they consume. 
Water is more critical for growing kids and pregnant or lactating nannies 
than it is for other goats. The smaller an animal is the more water it 
needs relative to its size. This is because it has a large body surface in 
relation to its body size which makes it susceptible to heat stress. 
Goats tend to thrive better than sheep under difficult range conditions 
because they are able to tolerate brackish or salty water which is often 
found in high temperature areas or near the sea. For example, salt 
concentrations of 10,000 ppm (parts per million) in the water are well 
tolerated.

In arid regions or in the dry season the number of watering places 
declines and flocks may have to travel long distances to drink and then 
wait their turn behind herds of larger camels or cattle. This reduces time 
available for grazing as well as causing overgrazing around waterholes. 
Supplementation 
Most farmers in the tropics cannot afford to give their goats any feed 
over and above what the animals can graze. By being able to select 
particular plants, goats may be able to increase the quality of their diet, 
especially with regard to energy or protein levels. In practice, their diet 
consists almost entirely of low-valve roughages. In these situations 
feeding a supplement to the diet can have a dramatic effect on 
productivity especially during the dry season, during late pregnancy or 
where animals are still fed. 
Supplement can be given as: 
• Concentrates containing extra energy (molasses, cereals) 
• Protein source (legumes) 
• Non-protein nitrogen (urea) 
• Minerals/vitamins (salt licks). 
Supplementary feeding is a costly exercise and only worthwhile if the 
improvement in performance gained it greater than the cost. If feeding 
pregnant nannies in the final month of gestation gives larger kids that 
grow well and can be sold for higher prices then supplementation may 
be worth doing. This is especially so if the supplementation is cheap to 
obtain. Tree fodder is one example and agricultural by-products may be 
the other. 
Practical feeding 
In practical terms the following period are important ones to consider 
when feeding goats: 
• Bucks and nannies 1 month before mating 
• Nannies for the 3 weeks after mating 
• Nannies the final month before kidding 
• First 2 months of lactation 
• Growing kids, especially post weaning. 
Only in selected situations are concentrates likely to be either available 
or given as a supplement. More likely supplements are legumes or crop 
residues. These might include leucaena, stylos, pigeon peas, sweet 
potato stems/leaves, groundnut haulm and cassava leaves.


When not being used for mating, bucks do not normally need 
supplementary feed. A small quantity of concentrate in the 3-4 week 
period before breeding will help build up body condition of bucks. This 
is important if the males have many nannies to mate or if climatic 
conditions are harsh. Bucks can lose a great deal of weight during the 
mating period. 
Feeding nannies immediately before and for three weeks after mating 
keeps them in good condition and will help the implantation of fertilized 
eggs in the uterus. 
By far the most critical period during which correct feeding is important 
for the nanny is the last month of pregnancy when the foetuses are 
growing very rapidly and causing a severe strain on the mother’s body 
reserves. Reducing the ration immediately after kidding and then 
building it up again for the first three weeks of the lactation until 
weaning, will encourage good milk production. 
If nannies are in very poor condition at weaning, supplementary feeding 
will enable them to regain body condition and to be in a good state for 
mating and conception. It is hard to justify the cost of feeding kids 
concentrates. Supplementary feeding of kids after weaning will stop 
them losing weight that often occurs when the nannies’ milk is no longer 
available to them. 
3.5 Feeding and Grazing Behaviour of Goats 
Many parts of the tropics have long periods when little or no rain falls 
consequently vegetations dies back and surface water disappears. The 
quantity of the vegetation also declines, with the best being eaten first. 
The longer the dry period lasts the poorer the quality of the roughage 
becomes (Fig 3.2). Goats will then eat less of this material. 
If the nutrients in the feed are less than required for an animal’s 
maintenance it will begin to lose weight as body reserves are depleted. 
As this happens the females will become anoestrus and so not breed. 
Nannies that are already pregnant will produce very weak kids. In very 
long dry seasons animals will die, with the youngest, weakest and oldest 
dying first. 
Goat keepers may counter these adverse effects by feeding goats on tree 
leaves or legumes. This practice can lead to deforestation problems 
when many animals are kept. This has happened in some areas of the 
third world such as Nepal and the Sahel region of Africa.

Goats are selective and agile feeders. They will walk long way searching 
for feed and are happier having a range of vegetation available to them 
including trees, shrubs and grasses. Shoots and leaves are preferred to 
stem. In intensive unit, if not managed effectively, goats will refuse and 
spoil a high percentage of forage offered. 
When goats are first let out on to pastures in the mornings they will 
initially graze unselectively but then start to wander and become 
increasingly selective. Unlike sheep, goats will scatter and graze and 
browse individually, climbing trees or standing on their hind legs to 
browse at higher levels. They will stop grazing if disturbed, for example, 
by rain. In hot conditions goats favour grazing in the early morning and 
evening. In Arabia they will graze at night if allowed, preferring to seek 
out comfortable shade during the heat of the day. 
Where goat keepers can control their animals under extensive system 
they may be able to use range better if they allow sheep and goats to 
graze together. These two species are complementary in habit which 
means more animals may be kept in a set area. The sheep will graze the 
lower grasses whilst the goats will browse shrubs and trees. 
Good goat keepers will know the browsing habits and movement 
patterns of the flock and their favourite watering and sheltering spots. 
They will allow natural resting times in the middle of a day and know 
when to move the flock. Goats are much more difficult to move during 
cold, wet or windy periods. 
Goats change their feeding habit between seasons. In the dry season they 
will eat bushes and trees which in wetter periods they would ignore, 
preferring in this season grasses and legumes. They can distinguish 
bitter, sweet, salty and sour tastes and show tolerance to bitter and salty 
tastes. 
Although goats do not flock together in the way that sheep do, they do 
have a good herd instinct and if handled frequently become used to 
being moved or herded in large groups. Calling to animals in specific 
sound or tonation when feeding, will teach them to move together for 
handling. Identifying the dominant females and males whom others will 
follow can also be useful. 
 Agro-industry by-products 
Industries that process agricultural produce often leave residues by-
products that can be fed to animals. The feeding value of such by 
products varies considerable. Some examples are listed in Table 9.7 but 
the same product’s feeding value will change with different samples 
feeding a product to a small number of goats to observe the effect is one

solution to this problem. Some by-products, such as molasses and 
cassava, are high in energy but low in protein whilst others, such as 
linseed meal or desiccated cotton seek cake, have good levels of both 
protein and energy.

3.6 Reproduction and Kid Rearing 
1. Terminology 
Listed below are some of the most common terms used when referring 
to reproduction in goats: 
Fertility ability to produce sperm or ova
Prolificacy ability to produce young
Litter size number of kids born to each nanny each birth
Kidding percentage number of kids born or reared in relation to nannies 
exposed to buck
Kidding interval number of days between two successive kidding 
Service implant of fertilized ova that grows to foetus 
Foetus growing kid in uterus 
Service mating
Heat oestrus 
Fertility is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. 
For the farmer, fertility is seen as the ease with which a doe successfully 
conceives after kidding. The shorter the period, or the fewer the number 
of services, the more profitable the exercise; and the happier the farmer. 
The farmer would consider the number of services needed to get the 
nanny pregnant to be an indicator of fertility of the buck.

Prolificacy improves with age, with most nannies progressively giving 
more kids per litter up to their fifth or sixth kidding. Prolificacy is 
measured by litter size, kidding interval, kidding percentage or service 
period. These figures are usually expressed as per animal or for a group 
of animals. Thus the average kidding interval for the West Africa Dwarf 
is 258 days. Its litter size is 1-6 kids. 
4.0 CONCLUSION 
The significance of goat production makes understanding of its 
management worthwhile and highly profitable. The adaptive 
characteristics and productivity of goats endear goat production to 
nearly every household in the rural and urban area of Nigeria.
