<h2> Collection of milt from male</h2>

Milt can be collected by sacrificing the male, this can be achieved by placing the male fish on its back and by using a pair of scissors the abdomen is cut open to expose the testes, and care should be taken not to damage the testes. The intestine should be moved aside to allow ease of removal of the testes, cleaning of the testes of blood smear should be done using filter paper; contact with water should be avoided as this will inactivate the sperm cells, and the testes should always be removed before stripping of the eggs (Plate 5).

<h2> Stripping of female</h2>

This is the removal of the ripe eggs from abdomen by gently pressing several times until a high percentage of the eggs are removed. This should be done when the eggs are already running which is usually between 10 to 12 hours depending on the temperature (Plate 6). The fish is carefully caught from the receptacle, two people are required during this operation, and a wet towel is used to handle the fish at both the tail region and the head and the abdomen is gently pressed from the anterior end several times, while the eggs are carefully collected in a clean dry plastic bowl.
