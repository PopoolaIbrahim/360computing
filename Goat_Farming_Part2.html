Intensive 
Intensive systems of goat production are those where the goats are 
confined and so not allowed to forage for themselves. In Oman, large 
numbers of goats are reared for meat production in small group of 10-15 
animals of similar ages and separated into males and female. Two 
hundred goats may be kept on one hectare of land with no access to 
grazing. These feed lot or zero grazing systems involve feeding cut 
grasses (Rhodes, Buffel, and Signal) and cut legumes (leucaena, 
gliricidia, stylos) as well as concentrates, mineral and vitamins. 
Other system include grazing improved pastures where may be used to 
boost yield, supplementary feeding of agricultural by products and 
supervise grazing of animal on limited areas. In South India and parts of 
S.E Asia stall feeding of goats in crop growing areas is a very efficient 
method of converting poor value crop residues and tree leaves into 
useful feed production for humans. It also avoids damage by the goats to 
growing crops. 
Most intensive management involves high cost resulting from high 
labour cost, expensive feed, or a large investment in the inputs such as 
land or animals. It may be a combination of several factors to which 
there must be a high priced product. 
Keeping number of goats confined in a limited area requires meticulous 
health care if disease, particularly parasite problems, are to be avoided. 
Care must also be taken to see that all animal are properly fed, have 
access to clean water and are regularly cleaned out. 
Many methods of goat keeping combine the different systems of 
management as described here. It is, for example, common in parts of 
Africa to use children, on returning from school, to shepherd goats that 
are confined to stall during the day.

Principles of Goat Production 
Feed and Feeding 
Goats are animals known to convert low quality fibrous vegetation into 
useful products for man. These include meat, milk, skin and manure. 
Goats prefer a varied diet and to be able to wander and browse a broad 
range of plants. In traditional systems they make good use of the 
available vegetation. Because of their browsing habit they are often able 
to exist in areas of low rainfall and poor growth, where cattle and even 
sheep would not prosper. If their numbers do not become excessive, a 
good ecological balance can be maintained. 
Goats, being inquisitive eaters, will eat all types of vegetation as well as 
articles which have little feed value, such as cardboard and human hairs. 
 
However, given the opportunity, they seek good pasture where they can 
select the grasses they prefer. They will often reject the legume clover 
which is favoured by sheep and cattle. This means that combining sheep 
and goats to graze in a single flock does not necessarily lead to 
competition between the two species. Where a wide range of plants is 
available it is possible to keep more animals on a given area of land 
because each species grazes on a different type of vegetation. 
Goats are ruminants. This means they have four – stomach digestive 
system which comprises rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum in 
the adult goat with which they extract nutrients from fibrous materials 
using bacteria and protozoa that live in the rumen and reticulum. Feed is 
initially chewed in the mouth and mixed with saliva before it passes to 
rumen. This material is returned to mouth for further chewing so that the 
particle size is reduced, speeding up subsequent digestion. This 
regurgitation is called chewing the cud. Like all ruminants goats can be 
seen chewing and re- chewing this material between grazing periods. 
They chew the cud more at night than during the day. After thoroughly 
chewing cud the feed passes to rumen and reticulum, where micro-
organism break it into simple chemicals which are either absorbed into 
the body or are used by the micro –organism to reproduce. 
The populations of micro-organisms break it into simple chemicals 
which are either absorbed into the body or are used by micro –organism 
found in the gut. Digestive microbes are specific to particular diets and 
gradually change in response to changes in the types of feed being eaten. 
If a sudden change of diet occurs the system is upset because the micro-
organisms cannot digest the new feeds. It takes days for the appropriate 
micro-organism populations to build up to cope with the new diet. The 
sudden introduction of a new feed can lead to scouring and loss of

condition or even death in severe cases. For goat keepers, this means 
that any change in diet must be very gradual. A new feed should be 
given in very small amounts at first, with the quantity being increased 
progressively over a period of days. 
The liquid mixture of rumen and reticulum passes to the omasum, where 
most of the water removed, and then to the abomasums. This stomach is 
very acidic and any micro-organism reaching it is killed. Digestion from 
this point progresses with the addition of enzymes which are secreted 
from the gut wall. The digestive contents are now broken down into 
nutrients that are useful to the body. These are absorbed by the small 
intestine. This part of the gut is very long but is accommodated as a 
series of coils so it takes up as little room as possible. More of the water 
is removed in the large intestine before the very dry dung pellets are 
expelled from the rectum through the anus. Goats are able to extract 
almost all of the water from the contents of the digestive system, which 
means they can make very efficient use of whatever water is available. 
This is one of the reasons why goats can survive in arid regions. It is 
considered a sign of good health if the dung is reasonable dry. 
Feed intake 
In the tropics, dairy goats will eat up to the equivalent of 4-5 per cent of 
their own body weight in dry matter daily. Meat goats will consume 
about three per cent. In cooler parts of the world dairy goats have been 
known to eat up to eight per cent. Goats have a much better capacity for 
forage than sheep of a similar size. How much a goat eats depends on 
its: 
• Age 
• Breed 
• Production capacity, or
• Whether it is pregnant or lactating.
Younger goats eat more than older ones because they are growing. 
Pregnant and lactating animals consume more than non-pregnant and 
non-lactating ones because they need more feed to produce milk and to 
enable the foetus to grow. 
Goats with free access to feed will vary their intake depending on the 
energy available from the feed. One average bigger goats eat more than 
smaller ones. All goats will eat more if the feed is in a fine rather than 
coarse form. The goat keeper can influence how much goats eat by: 
• How finely ground the feed is; and 
• How much useful energy the feed has (measure in ME per kg 
DM)

If hay or straw is chopped, more will be eaten than if fed without 
chopping. Finely chopped straw is often fed as part of a concentrate 
ration. More feed is eaten if the feed has a high energy density. So if a 
high-energy feed such as or molasses is mixed with a fibrous feed such 
as straw, goats will eat more. 
Feed intake is generally measured in dry matter terms. Dry matter (DM) 
is the amount of feed remaining when all the water has been removed. It 
is used as a guide to how much fresh or moist feed can be fed. 
Feeding example 30 kg goat 
 
A 30 kg goat requires: 
1. For maintenance 1.6% DM as % live weight = 0.5kg 
2. For production 3.0% DM as % live weight = 0.9kg 
 1.4kg 
If DM of feed is 25% four times as much is needed to achieve a set 
target figure, therefore: 
• 1.4 x 4 = 6.4 kg fresh material daily 
Nutrients 
Much of the information used to calculate nutrient requirements for 
goats is based on research with sheep and cattle. 
For goats you need a balance of five basic components. 
1. energy 
2. protein 
3. vitamins 
4. minerals 
5. water 
All goats have a basic need (maintenance) for energy nutrients but some 
will also require additional (production) nutrients at particular times, for 
example, nannies in the final stages of pregnancy or when lactating or 
kids when they are growing. 
The energy from feed is used by the goat for maintenance. Maintenance 
energy is that amount needed to maintain the animal in a stable body 
condition and provide enough energy for walking. Production is that 
required for growing and for producing milk or a foetus. It is required 
over and above the energy for maintenance. Not all energy in feed can 
be used by the goat and so only the part that, the metabolisable energy

(ME) part, is used to calculate how much energy is needed for a goat’s 
maintenance and production. 
Energy is measure in Mega joules (MJ) or calories. (One calories = 4.2 
joules). An average diet contains about 8.5 Mega joules (MJ) of 
Metabolisable Energy (ME) per kilogram of dry matter (DM). However, 
the amount may range from 6 to 13 MJ/ME/kg DM. 
To estimate the amount of ME in a feed it is necessary to undertake a 
feeding trail to find out the digestibility measures of that part of the feed 
which is absorbed from the digestive tract into the body. There is direct 
relationship with ME, shown as: 
• ME = 0.15 X DOMD 
ME is in mega joules per kilogram of dry matter (Mj/kg DM). DOMD is 
digestibility of organic matter in the dry matter. 
Alternatively, small amounts of feed can be placed in an animal’s rumen 
in a small bag and the amount absorbed recorded over a period of time. 
Very few of either of these measurements have been undertaken with 
goats in the tropics, so the amount of information specifically applicable 
to goats is limited. In consequence, calculations for nutrition often have 
and also often based on data from the temperate regions of the world 
rather than the tropic. 
Table below has been derived from experiments undertaken in the 
tropics and gives a guide to daily amounts of energy required by goats of 
different weights kept under different husbandry systems. 
For pregnant or lactating females or growing kids energy is required 
over and above the amount needed to maintain body condition given in 
Table 9.3

For lactation the energy (ME) required relates to the energy content and 
composition of the milk produced. A typical energy requirement is 
shown below:

DP = digestible protein 
Pregnant goat requires sufficient energy to feed the growing foetus or 
fetuses. In the last part of pregnancy the female’s requirement rises 
substantially and particularly if she is carrying two or three kids. Other 
nutrients follow a similar demand curve. The quality of feed and its 
energy density must rise in this part of the pregnancy if the kids are to be 
born at a reasonable weight. If the nanny receives too little energy she 
will become thin as her own body reserves are used to grow the kids. 
She may develop pregnancy toxemia (ketosis) and die if the situation 
gets worse. Levels of energy intake are also required to achieve sexual 
maturity and for successful conception. 
For growth the level of energy available to growing kids depends on the 
rate at which they grow. Research in East Africa suggests 0.035 MJ/ME 
is required per gram of growth. A 20 kg animal gaining 50g daily 
requires 1.75 MJ/ME for growth. 
All goats should have a minimal level of crude protein each day. Crude 
protein (CP) is calculated from the nitrogen content of a feed. 
1. CP = nitrogen x 6.25 
 (It is expressed as a percentage (%)) 
Protein can also be synthesized from non-protein nitrogen such as urea. 
The crude protein content of a feed is calculated in the laboratory and, in 
temperate countries, tables are available showing values for many 
feeding materials. This is infuriately, not the case with most tropical 
feedstuffs. Much less is known about specific protein requirements for 
goats in the tropics. Figures that relate to sheep are commonly used 
instead (Table9.5).

Oils seed by-products 
Green legumes 
Fish meal
2-4.4 
10-12 
10-22 
22-55 
17-20 
65-70
So if a very high fibrous diet (e.g. straw) is fed it may be low in protein. 
Additional crude protein, such as fish or oilseed meals, should then be 
added to the feed as a supplement. 
A 35-40 kg doe requires about 30g/day DCP (Digestible crude protein) 
for maintenance. For pregnancy and lactation this rises to 70g/day. For 
growing kids the requirements vary with size of kid and daily rate of 
growth. A 10 kg kid gaining 100g/day would need some 30g DCP 
whilst one at 30g would need 50g/day.
Vitamins
Little research has been done on the vitamin requirements of goats and 
on vitamin deficiencies in tropical diets. In many situations goats do not 
suffer from a lack of vitamins where they have access to pasture or 
rangeland. Most diets have sufficient vitamin A (carotene), Vitamins D 
and K if green vegetation is available. If vitamin B12 is deficient, as 
characterised by anemia, loss of appetite and poor growth goats should 
be given cobalt, which will assist intestinal micro flora to synthesis the 
vitamin. Vitamin C does not need to be added to the diet as the goat is 
able to synthesize sufficient for its needs.
