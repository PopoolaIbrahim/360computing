<h2>Water Quality Management</h2>

Water quality is the most important factor affecting fish health and performance in aquaculture production systems. Good water quality refers to what the fish wants and not what the farmer thinks the fish wants. This means that farmers must understand the water quality requirements of the fish under culture very well. Fish live and are totally dependent on the water they live in for all their needs. Different fish species have different and specific range of water quality aspects (temperature, pH, oxygen concentration, salinity, hardness, etc.) within which they can survive, grow and reproduce. Within these tolerance limits, each species has its own optimum range, that is, the range within which it performs best. It is therefore very important for fish producers to ensure that the physical and chemical conditions of the water remain, as much as possible, within the optimum range of the fish under culture all the time. Outside these optimum ranges, fish will exhibit poor growth, erratic behaviour, and disease symptoms or parasite infestations. Under extreme cases, or where the poor conditions remain for prolonged periods of time, fish mortality may occur. Pond water contains two major groups of substances:
<br>
<br>
a)       Suspended particles made of non-living particles and very small plants and animals, the plankton.
<br>
b)       Dissolved substances made of gases, minerals and organic compounds.
<br>
<h3>i.                    Water Temperature</h3>

Fish are "cold-blooded" and therefore assume the temperature of the water they live in. Water temperature is therefore the most important physical factor for fish survival and growth. Body temperature, and thus the water temperature, has an effect on level of activity, behavior, feeding, growth, and reproduction of the fish. Each species has its tolerance limits and optimum range. When water temperatures are outside the optimum range, fish body temperature will either be too high or too low and fish growth will be affected or the fish will even die.

<h3>ii.                  Water pH and Acidity</h3>

Pond water may be acidic, alkaline or neutral. Depending on this, water will react in different ways with substances dissolved in it. It will also affect in different ways the plants and animals living in the water. The measure of the alkalinity or acidity of water is expressed by its pH value. The pH value ranges from 0 to 14, with pH 7 indicating that the water is neutral. Values smaller than 7 indicate acidity, while those greater than 7, alkalinity. Fish production can be greatly affected by excessively low or high pH.
<br>
<br>
Extreme pH values can even kill the fish. The growth of natural food organisms may also be greatly reduced. The critical pH values vary according to the fish species, the size of individual fish and other environmental conditions. For example, fish are more susceptible to extreme pH during their reproductive seasons. Eggs, fry, fingerlings and juveniles are more sensitive than adults. Waters ranging in pH from 6.5 to 8.5 (at sunrise) are generally the most suitable for pond fish production. Most cultured fish will die in waters with pH below 4.5 and 10 or above. Fish reproduction and general performance can be greatly affected at pH below 6.5 and above 8.5.
<br>
<br>
Pond water with pH unfavorable for fish production can be corrected by use of lime and alkaline fertilizers if the pH is below 6.5 at sunrise or by use acid fertilizers, if the pH is above 8.5 at sunrise. Ensuring that soil pH and acidity are within acceptable limits is a necessary part of managing the alkalinity, hardness, and pH of the water, which were discussed above. The key is to keep soil pH at 6.5 or above, which will usually maintain water pH, hardness, and alkalinity at desirable levels. Pond soil pH can be kept at the right level by drying the pond for at least two weeks after each harvest before refilling and restocking; and by applying lime (preferably agricultural limestone) to the pond after each harvest. Normally lime should be applied to the pond bottom before it is refilled, but if necessary, it can be applied to the water surface after filling the pond. Only recommended liming materials and application rates should be used.
<br>
<h3>iii.                Dissolved Oxygen in Fish Ponds</h3>

The most important gas dissolved in water is oxygen. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is essential for respiration and decomposition. Dissolved oxygen in water comes from atmospheric oxygen and photosynthesis. The atmospheric oxygen diffuses and dissolves into the water. But the diffusion and its subsequent dissolves into water is a slow process. The major source of dissolved oxygen in ponds is photosynthesis. However this process depends on the amount of light available to the aquatic plants in water. Oxygen production decreases during cloudy days, stops at night and decreases with increase in water depth; the rate of the decrease depending on the water turbidity. Signs indicating reduced DO in pond water include reluctance of fish to feed or fish coming to breathe or gasp for oxygen on surface water. The DO content of pond water can be increased through structures that cause water to splash e.g. by use of cascades along the inlet canal and raised inlet pipes before the water gets into the ponds or by use of mechanical aerators for the emergency aeration of pond water.
<br>
<h3>iv.                Ammonia</h3>

Un-ionized ammonia (NH3) concentrations in pond water should be kept below 0.5 mg/l Concentrations of this form of ammonia, which is toxic to fish, are influenced by DO, pH, and alkalinity, therefore it is important to manage this by:
<br>
<br>
a)       Maintaining water alkalinity at 40 mg Calcium carbonate per litre or above
<br>
<br>
b)       Keeping pH near neutral, and at least below 9.0
<br>
<br>
c)       Keeping DO concentrations high
<br>
<h2>Fish Feeds and Feeding</h2>

Feeding of fish during culture aims at producing the maximum weight of marketable fish within the shortest time at least cost. The feed should supply the energy for movement and all other activities the fish engages in. It should also provide nutrients for body maintenance, growth and reproduction.
<br>
<br>
Feeding increases fish growth and makes fish farming profitable. Feeds must be nutritious and economical in any farming system and must be properly managed to be effective.
<br>
<br>
The nutrients needed by fish include carbohydrates, fats, protein, vitamins and minerals. Other components of feed are fibre and moisture are important as well. Fish diet must contain all the nutrients in the right proportions to bring about growth.
<br>
<br>
<h4>i.                    Types of Feed</h4>

Fish in culture can be maintained solely on natural foods in a pond, or on artificial (formulated) feedstuffs or a combination of the two (Plate 10). The natural foods in a fish pond include mainly phytoplankton, and also zooplankton, detritus, insect larvae, etc. The abundance of phytoplankton in a fish pond is shown by the extent of greenness of the pond water. The acceptable greenness of the water can be ascertained by the use of a Secchi disc.

<h2>Plate 10: Imported Floating feed bags</h2>

 

The growth of phytoplankton in pond water can be enhanced by fertilization of the water, using inorganic or organic fertilizers. The most commonly used organic fertilizers are droppings of farm animals such as poultry, pigs and cattle, and compost. If the natural food in a pond is insufficient in quantity or lacks certain nutrients necessary for adequate growth, leaves of legumes, and agricultural by-products such as rice bran, wheat bran, groundnut peels, groundnut cake, etc can be used as supplementary feeds. Formulated feeds can be used as supplementary feeds or as a sole source of nutrients for a fish in a pond.
<br>
<br>
<h4>ii.                  Feed and Feeding Practices</h4>

Formulated or compounded feeds may be given to fish in the dry, moist or wet form. Dried compounded feeds can be presented to fish as powder, pellets, or crumbles. They can be fed to fish by broadcasting (Plate 11). Pellets are most popular and their shape and size would depend on the age of the fish (Plate 12). Floating Pellets are desirable for fish that feed from the surface layers of water (e.g. Tilapia), while sinking pellets are good for fish that feed from the bottom (e.g. Clarias sp).

<h2>Formulated Feeds</h2>

Formulated feed for tilapia should contain between 27% and 40 % protein. For fry and fingerlings, the feed should have small particles and a protein content of about 35% - 40%, while for adults the protein content could be between 27% and 30%. It is advisable for the fish farmer to constantly monitor the quality and quantity of pond water. For Catfish, formulated feeds should not be less than 42% protein for fingerlings and not less than 35% protein for adults
