<h3>Broiler Chicken Production</h3>
<img src="images34.jpeg" style="width: 300;height:300;">
<br>

Broilers are birds which have been selected for fast growth so as to be ready for the market at 
about 8 weeks. Broilers are usually reared on Deep Litter (Fig 18). There have been reported 
cases of production on cages but with consequence of breast blisters which reduce the birds
market value. If cages are used, the floor should be covered with soft material. The attainment of market weight of broilers depends mostly on the quantity and quality of feeds.

3.1 Management of broilers
The management of broilers includes brooding, which has being fully discussed in Unit 2 
Module 4. The Brooder House must be well ventilated and the stocking density high. The 
intensity of light should be low as broilers require light only to see their feed. A high light 
intensity will depress growth rate. Feeding must be adequate to prevent cannibalism in the flock. 
Broiler rations are of two types – broiler starter mash (fed from day old to about 4-5 weeks) and 
broiler finisher (fed from about 4-5 weeks to market weight). A batch system of broiler 
production is recommended. This is known as ―All in All out‖ system. The production schedule 
should be such that the whole house can be cleared in between batches to prevent the build-up of 
disease organisms.

3.2 Feeding of Broilers
Broilers are male and female birds reared for meat. Broilers when properly fed and cared for, are 
ready for the market between 6 and 8 weeks age. The speed of attainment of market weight of 
2.5-3.0kg live weight depends mostly on the quantity of feeds.
3.3 Supply of Nutrients
Energy
Broilers require energy for growth of tissue, maintenance and activity. Carbohydrate sources, 
such as corn and wheat, and various fats or oils are the major source of energy in poultry feeds. 
Energy levels in diets are expressed in Mega Joules (MJ/kg) or Kilocalories (kcal/kg) of 
Metabolizable Energy (ME).
Protein
Feed proteins, such as those in cereals and soybean meal, are complex compounds that are 
broken down by digestion into amino acids. These amino acids are absorbed and assembled into

body proteins that are used in the construction of body tissues, e.g. muscles, nerves, skin and 
feathers. Dietary Crude Protein levels do not indicate the quality of the proteins in feed 
ingredients. A good protein quality diet is based on the level, balance and digestibility of 
essential amino acids in the final mixed feed. Higher levels of digestible amino acids have been 
shown to improve profitability by increasing broiler performance and processing yield. 
Macro Minerals
The provision of the correct levels of the major minerals in the appropriate balance is important 
for high-performing broilers. The macro minerals involved are calcium, phosphorus, sodium, 
potassium and chloride.
Calcium and Phosphorus: Calcium in the diet of broilers influences growth, feed efficiency, 
bone development, leg health, nerve function and the immune system. It is vital that calcium 
is supplied in adequate quantities and on a consistent basis. Phosphorus, like calcium, is 
required in the correct form and quantity to optimize skeletal structure and growth. 
Sodium, Potassium and Chloride: These minerals are needed for general metabolic 
functions. Shortages can affect feed intake, growth and blood pH. Excess levels of these 
minerals result in increased water intake and subsequent poor litter quality. 
Trace Minerals and Vitamins
Trace Minerals and Vitamins are needed for all metabolic functions. Appropriate Vitamin and 
trace Mineral Supplementation depends on the feed ingredients used and local circumstances. 
Due to differences in vitamin levels of various cereals, the level of supplementation of some 
vitamins must be modified. Accordingly, separate recommendations are usually made for some 
vitamins, depending on the cereals (e.g. Wheat versus maize) used in diet.
Enzymes
Enzymes are now being routinely used in poultry feeds to improve digestibility of feed 
ingredients. In general, enzymes that act on carbohydrates, proteins and plant-bound minerals are 
available.
Two types of feed are usually fed:
a. Broiler Starter Diet: These diets contain between 22 and 24% crude protein and an energy 
content of 3000 Kcal/kg. The feed is usually fed from day-old up to four weeks of age.
Grower Feeds
Broiler Grower Feed is generally fed for 14 to 16 days following the Starter. Starter to Grower 
transition will involve a change of texture (maintaining the crude protein and energy value) from 
crumbs/mini-pellets to pellets. Depending on the pellet size produced, it may be necessary to 
feed the first delivery of Grower as crumbs or mini-pellets.
b. Broiler Finisher Diets: These diets contain 20% Crude Protein and Energy content of 3000 
kcal/kg to 3200 Kcal/kg. This diet should be fed from 25 days of age up to 8 weeks of age.

Broiler Finisher Feeds account for the major volume and cost of feeding a broiler. It is therefore 
important that feeds are designed to maximize financial return for the type of products being 
produced. Finisher Feeds should be given from 4 to 5 weeks until processing.
3.4 Environment
Nitrogen and Ammonia emissions can be reduced by minimizing excess Crude Protein levels in 
the Feed. This is achieved by formulating diets to balanced recommended levels of digestible 
essential amino acids, rather than to minimum Crude Protein levels. 
Phosphorus excretion rates can be reduced by feeding closely to the bird‘s requirement and 
utilizing phytase enzymes. 
Birds must be protected from poor ventilation and extremes in temperature. The house should be 
constructed with their length parallel to wind direction.
