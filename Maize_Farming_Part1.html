<br>

<h2>Site Selection</h2>

Select a well drained fertile Sandy loam soil that is rich in organic matter but avoid water logging condition.
<br>
<h2>Field Measurement</h2>

Field measurement is very important because its accuracy guidesfarmers to know their farmsizesforvital decision on farm operations including the right amount of inputs needed and the anticipated yields from the farms. The use of (Geographical positioning System, GPS) hands receiver has simplified the rigor of land measurement. Land area can be easily measured using GPS receiver while transecting the perimeter of the land. For field measurement using GPS, refer to GPS manual
<br>
<h2>Land Preparation</h2>

In the southern parts of the country where vegetation cover is fairly dense, land clearing should be carried out well ahead of the rains. Make ridges as soon as the rains start. Although the crop benefits from the deep cultivation, maize yields are not reduced when zero tillage is adopted. Make ridges at 75cm apart. Because the soils in the savannas are loose, animal drawn implements can be used for preparing ridges or by had hoe and tractor mounted tillage equipment.

<h2>Variety and seed selection</h2>

Request for information on sources of improved seed varieties suitable to your location from the ADPs Research Institute or NASC. About 20kg of maize seed is recommended to plant one hectare. Some recommended varieties are listed below:
