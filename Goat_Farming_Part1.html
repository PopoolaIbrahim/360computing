<h3>Goat Farming</h3>

Goats were probably the first ruminant animal to be domesticated some 
8000 years ago. In the ancient civilisations along the rivers of Nile (in 
Africa), Tigris and Euphrates (in Asia) and Indus (in India) when 
populations migrated from these areas, the domesticated goats spread 
through the continents of Europe and America. There are several good 
reasons for keeping goats even in preference to larger animals such as 
cattle. 
These include: 
(a) low purchase price 
(b) goats reproduce at an early age and have younger ones per litter 
than cattle. 
(c) they have innate ability to survive on low quality feed or in 
difficult conditions or on relatively small amount of feed. In 
Nigeria goat keeping is a major form of investment which 
keepers in rural area easily use to meet urgent financial needs. A 
lot of social and religious functions demand the use of goat for 
exchange of goodwill, marital gifts, sacrifices and ceremonies. 
Goat meat is a highly cherished delicacy in drinking places and 
hotels because of its favourable attributes of low fat, flavour and 
relatively low fibre. For these and other peculiarities of goat 
keeping, its production is popular by its contribution to the 
national economy through the earning of foreign exchange from 
export of goat skin also known as “Morocco Leather” as well as

providing employment for a host of individual being a major 
commodity for trade between regions. 


Origins and history 
Goats and sheep are small ruminant belonging to the tribe, called 
caprini. This tribe is divided into two parts or genera, Capra and 
Hemitragus. The Hemitragus, also called Tahrs, are wild goats found in 
Arabia, the Himalayas and south India. They have short stout horns, no 
beards, and long shaggy coats. They have only 48 chromosomes in their 
cells and do not cross breed with the Capra, which has 60. The 
domesticated goat originates from the Capra genus and this includes five 
groups or species predominating in regions indicated as follows: 
• Capra hircus (Bezoar) West Asia 
• Capra ibex (Ibex) Central Asia, Near East, Alps 
• Capra caucasia (Tur) West Asia 
• Capra pyrenaica (Spanish Ibex) Pyrenees 
• Capra fakciberi (Markhor) Afghanistan, Pakistan 
The Bezoar is thought to the main ancestor of today’s domesticated 
goat, but the Markhor has had a strong influence in Central Asia where 
many goats show the long coarse hair and scimitar type horns which are 
characteristic of both species. The influence of the Ibex is seen in the 
prominent ‘Roman nose of breeds such as the Nubian, Jamnapari and 
Beetal. 
Distinguishing the origin of goats is not an easy task. It is practically 
difficult to tell the difference between a goat and a sheep. The most

effective and simple away is to look at the tail. In good health and not 
under stress, a goat’s tail points upwards, that of a sheep hangs down. 
Goats can also have beards and the male have tail glands, which sheep 
do not. Horn shapes and tail or fibre covering may help classify goats, 
but this can be an unreliable method. 
2. Goat population and distribution 
There are some 639 million goats in the world, of which nearly 80 per 
cenr are found in the tropic and sub- tropics. This compares with world 
population of 1,067 million for sheep and 1,306 million for cattle. All of 
these figures are estimates.

The largest populations of goat are found in Africa and on the Indian sub 
– continent. In the tropics, 20 per cent of the ruminants are goats. It is 
also known that the population of goats has been growing at a faster rate 
than other ruminants. Goats are found in all types of environments, from 
arid to humid zones. They do very well in the drier tropics, where their 
ability to withstand dehydration and their browsing habit enable them to 
survive where cattle or sheep cannot. This means that they can exist in 
fragile ecosystems such as the Sahel where, consequently, they are often 
blamed, sometime unfairly, for degrading the natural resource base. 
3.2 Breeds of Goat 
There are some 300 breeds of goat, many of them located in the tropics 
and subtropics. They have developed not only in response to a particular 
environment but also because man has selected animals for specific 
characteristics. These characteristics include temperament, productivity 
and ease of management. There has also been a great deal of crossing 
between breeds to produce animals that have the characteristic that are 
genetically controlled. Goat breeds are not well recorded in the tropics 
and are often defined only by the geographical area in which they live.

Goats can be characterised by 
• Origin 
• Function 
 milk, meat, fibre 
• Appearance 
Ear shape and length 
Body size 
Height 
 Colour 
Horned or polled shape of face 
No one particular method of identification is satisfactory when taken by 
itself. Details of some of the most interesting and important breeds in 
Africa are presented in Table 9.2.

Description of Goat Breeds in Nigeria 
Sahel Goat (W. African Long- legged goat) 
This is also known as the Arab goat in Chad and the Maure in 
Mauritania. It is similar to other breeds in North Africa, being very long 
legged (70-85cm), and is found in the semi-arid areas in the north of W. 
Africa. Many goats of Sahel breed are kept by pastoralists in mixed 
flocks with sheep. Not being trypano-tolerant the breed does not survive 
in forest and dense savanna where the tsetse fly, the carrier of 
trypanosomiasis, is found. 
Males weigh 40 kg and females 27 kg when mature. They have small 
triangular heads, usually with horns. Their coats are short and very fine. 
Sahel goats are primarily kept for their meat, and little milk (less than 80 
litres/lactation) is produced. Around 40 per cent of births give twins, and 
under pastoral conditions the kids grow very slowly. A carcass dressing 
percentage of 48-50 per cent is common in adult goat. Like many desert 
breeds, Sahel goats have the ability to maintain their weight long periods 
under adverse conditions. 
Maradi 
This distinctive re-coloured goat lives in Nigeria and Niger where it is 
kept in small flocks by Hausa-speaking tribes. Animal are confined 
away from growing crops and may be stall-fed. The breed is well 
adapted to arid conditions and grows to 25 kg for females and 27 kg for 
males. Both sexes have similar shaped horns and males have beards. 
Because of the importance of the breed for their skins, the ratio of males 
to females in flocks is higher than in many other breeds. The skins are of 
the highest quality in the tannery trade and are known as Morocco. Their 
ease of tanning makes them very popular for shoes and gloves. 
Twining is very common and a litre size of 1.8 is the average. Milk 
yields of 0.5-1.0 litre per day have been recorded in experimental 
stations over three-month periods. Nannies with twins out-yield those 
with singles by some 20 per cent. When killed for meat the carcass yield 
is 45-50 per cent of live weight.

West African Dwarf Breed (Fouta Djallon Dwarf)
This breed is very short-legged and measure 50 cm or less in height. 
They are usually also in the 18-25 kg weight range. Dwarfs can be 
proportionately small all over or just short in the leg. 
This dwarf breed is found in west and central Africa, along the Atlantic 
coast. It is trypanosome- tolerant and is adapted to the humid forest 
zone. Goats are kept in small groups and left to roam about homesteads 
as scavengers. In Nigeria, few bucks are kept. In Senegal, flocks are 
owned by women and numbers rarely exceed five. When crops are 
growing goats will be tethered. 
Bucks weigh 25 kg and nannies 22 kg when mature. Their height is 30-
50 cm. Both sexes have horns and toggles whilst bucks have beards. 
Colours vary from dark brown to white and red. Twinning is very 
common, so average litter size ranges from 1.4 to 1.85kids. Milk yields 
reach 0.3 litre per day. 
3.3 Systems of Goat Production 
A number of different of goat production systems exist, including 
subsistence, extensive and intensive. The number of goats kept is often a 
helpful factor that indicates the type of system. 
 Subsistence 
Subsistent farmer usually keep small number of animal and manage to 
use whatever feed resource are available at village level. This may 
involve feeding crop or household residues to stall-fed goats, tethering 
individual animals to verges or allowing goats to scavenge. 
Tethering is common in parts of South East Asia, South America and 
the Caribbean where crops are grown and the goat must be prevented 
from damaging feed or cash crops. Goats are tied with ropes or chains to 
pegs, trees or post to constrain their movement. They are moved to a 
fresh area of grazing once the current patch is eaten down. 
Supplementary feeding with crop residues or household waste may be 
given, but not usually concentrate. Water is provided at night, when the 
goat is returned to its home. Goat may be tethered in small groups or 
even led by ropes held by children or woman. 
In the middle East, where there is little groundcover for goat to graze, 
especially in the summer, small groups of goat owned by farmers 
growing dates and catching fish are kept in tiny shaded corrals. There

they exist on a combination of cut grass legumes and leftovers from the 
house meals. 
Also in the same region are to be found small flock of scavenging goats 
that, during hours, forage in dustbins, on rubbish dumps, in urban 
building sites, unguarded gardens and on low growing trees. Only at 
night do they make their own way back to their owner’s home. 
 Extensive 
Under extensive production systems, goats graze and browse large areas 
of land that are usually of a marginal nature, and unsuitable for other 
agricultural use. This is usually because rainfall is low or unreliable. 
Goats can make good use of these areas provided the number of animals 
is controlled to match the carrying capacity of the land. The carrying 
capacity is the amount of forage available to sustain a set number of 
animals in a given area. The size of flock within this system is often 
large, and other species, such as sheep, may also be grazed at the same 
time. 
Under sedentary systems the grazing available to a flock is limited by 
the distance it can travel daily to reach water, shelter at night and the 
pastures themselves. A sedentary system is one with a fixed homestead 
and set grazing area. Some flocks may be moved to grazing area in 
different part of the country to utilize seasonal grazing or crop residues 
that are available only for limited period of the year. This is a migratory 
system which in some part of the tropics has developed over many 
centuries to become a very efficient way of using marginal agricultural 
hands. 
In parts of African, Asia and India there are two traditional systems of 
extensive production which have utilized marginal area very 
successfully over long periods. These are nomadism and transhumance. 
Nomadism was widespread in the Sahel region of Africa and in the 
middle and near East but it is now becoming less common. Nomads 
have camps which they move depending upon the amount of water and 
pasture available within an area. As traditional livestock keepers they 
follow set routes within what are considered tribal lands. Modern day 
national boundaries are often ignored. 
Transhumance involves the movement of flocks between permanent 
settlement and temporary and seasonal pastures as well as between 
settlement and temporary and seasonal pastures as well as between 
different regional areas. In Europe the flocks are kept in the lower plains 
during a winter period and moved to higher mountainous area when the

climate is warm enough to allow vegetation to grow and be accessed. 
Apart from altitude, transhumance also occurs between different areas 
with the change of season, as in the north- south movement in the Sahel. 
Transhumance is found in Africa, S.E. Asia; the near and Middle East 
and also in the Mediterranean, Europe and S. America. Animal from 
different families may be grouped together for the summer as one large 
flock and goat keepers may be hired if the families have other duties. 
Goats are often moved to pastures at higher altitudes than cattle because 
they are more agile and can better use the sparser vegetable that grows at 
these heights.
