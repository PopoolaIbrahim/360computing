<h2>Planting dates, time and methods</h2>

Plant as soon as the rains are established, preferably immediately after a good rain. The establishment of the rains varies according to the different ecological zones and from one year to another. However, optimum planting date in the major ecological zones usually lies within the following ranges:
<br>
<br>
i. Sudan Savanna: third weeks of June to early July
<br>
<br>
ii. Northern Guinea Savanna: Last week in May 1stto 2 nd week in June
<br>
<br>
iii. Southern Guinea Savanna: Mid-May to second week in June
<br>
<br>
iv. Forest Zone: Late February March for the first season and late July-August for the second season.Plant extra or early maturing varieties by late July and early August in order to allow maturity time to coincide with on-set of dry season

Fid. 4 : Planting maize seeds at recommended spacing
<br>
<h2>Soil Management</h2>

It is important to return crop residues of the previous year into the soil where maize is to be planted. This will help in soil improvement organic matter and provide good aeration for the soil. It is also important to grow maize in rotation with legume crops to provide natural soil enrichment.
<br>
<br>
Integrated soil fertility management
<br>
<br>
The fertilizer nutrients recommended for maize is 100kg N, 50kg of single super phosphate (SUPA) and 50kg K2O per hectare in the Sudan ecology (Kano, Katsina, Bauchi, Zamfara, Gombe States) and 120kg N, 60kg P, and 60kg of k in the Northern Guinea Savanna (Kaduna, Niger, Adamawa States). The recommended N-fertilizer rate should be applied in two split applications. First dose is applied at planting or within the first week of planting (that is 50:50:50) using about 6 bags of NPK 15-15-15 while the 2nd dose of 50kg N (about two bags of urea) should be applied between 4 and 5 weeks after planting in the Southern and Northern Guineas Savannah zones but between 3 and 4 weeks after planting in the Sudan to extra early maize varieties. Al fertilizer should be buried during application. Weed the maize farm again before the application of the second fertilizer dose.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Weed Management</h2>

Weed 2 3 weeks after planting and second hoe weeding at 4 6 weeks after planting. Otherwise use chemical herbicides such as:
<br>
<br>
Lasso LG - 4 5lits/ha
<br>
<br>
Atrazine Liquid - 4 5lits/ha
<br>
<br>
Attrazine Powder 1.5-3kg/ha - Primagram - 3lit/ha
<br>
<br>
Measure 2-2.5 milk tin of Lasso GD into 15lits of clean water in CP 15 sprayer. Spray the herbicide within 1 2 days after planting maize on moist soil. Avoid spraying on dry soil.
