<h3>Catfish Farming</h3>
<img src="images31.jpeg" style="width: 400;height:400;">
<br>
Fish culture involves the controlled cultivation and harvesting of fish for either family consumption or sales in the market. A wide range of practices exists in culturing fish. Fish can be cultured in marine water (seawater), brackish water (mixture of sea and freshwater i.e. lagoons) or freshwater (rivers, streams and lakes in the inland). The African Catfish and Tilapia are the most cultured fish species in Nigeria (Plate 1a and 1b). Depending on the facilities designed to serve as enclosures in rearing, fish can be grown in earthen ponds, concrete tanks, cages, pens, or run-ways (Plate 2). The level of management practices can make a fish farm to be extensive or intensive system. When species combinations are taken into consideration, culture systems can be either monoculture (rearing only one type of fish) or polyculture (rearing two or more species of fish together). A fishpond is an enclosure (earthen or concrete) built to retain water for the purpose of growing fish. Growing fish in ponds allows feeding, breeding, growing and harvesting of the fish in a well-planned way.

<h2>Plate 2: Production Technologies popularly used in Aquaculture</h2>

Aquaculture management systems are classified mainly into three. These are extensive system, semi-intensive system, intensive system and hyper intensive system.
<br>
<br>
<h2>i.                    Extensive System </h2>

In this system cultured fish are exclusively dependent on natural productivity with little or no supplementation of feeds. There are no health management schedules or water quality monitoring. Fish yield is usually low in this system. The system is practiced more in natural ponds.

<h2>ii.                  Semi-Intensive System</h2>

Food supplementation in pond is a major management practice in this system. Culture facilities include earthen ponds, concrete ponds, plastic tanks and fibre tanks. Commercially compounded feeds are routinely fed to fish at recommended rates. Water quality and fish health are occasionally monitored. Fish yield are high in this system.

<h2>iii.                Intensive System</h2>

In this system, feed supplementation, water quality monitoring and health management are routine management practices. Fish yields are higher than in the semi-intensive system. Culture facilities include earthen ponds, concrete ponds, plastic tanks and fibre tanks.
<br>
<br>
Fish farming systems are also diverse and include for example:
<br>
<br>
1. Water-based systems (cages and pens, inshore/offshore).
<br>
2. Land-based systems (rainfed ponds, irrigated or flow-through systems, tanks and raceways).
<br>
3. Recycling systems (high control enclosed systems, more open pond based recirculation).
<br>
4. Integrated farming systems (e.g. livestock-fish, crops and fish and dual use aquaculture and irrigation ponds).
<br>
<br>
<h2> Types of Aquaculture Production System</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2>i. Pond culture</h2>

Pond aquaculture is the use of earthen impoundments, with or without drainage infrastructure incorporated, to grow fish. Ponds are the most widely used structure for commercial aquaculture production. Ponds (dams) for aquaculture production are generally static with limited water exchange but can be modified for suitable use. Ponds include earthen ponds, reservoirs, dams, burrow pits, concrete pond structure, etc. Pond structure can be drainable or undrainable.
<br>
<br>
<h2>ii. Cage culture</h2>

Cage culture is an aquaculture production system where fish are held in floating net pens. Cages are widely used in commercial aquaculture and individual cage units come in all shapes and sizes and can be tailored to suit individual farmer's needs. Cages can be used in both freshwater and marine environments with adequate security to prevent losses into high tides and poaching.
<br>
<h2>iii. Re-circulating aquaculture system</h2>

Re-circulating aquaculture systems (RAS) have limited water exchange (typically up to 10% per day) and reuse the culture water. Mechanical and biological water treatment is used to maintain water quality. RAS generally requires less area and water than conventional aquaculture, allows higher stocking densities and provides greater control over the culture environment. RAS may provide a bio-secure environment. Species grown using re-circulating aquaculture systems include African catfish.
<br>
<h2>iv. Flow through System</h2>

Flow-through systems are generally used for the intensive production of fish. A flow-through system may include earthen ponds, tanks or raceways. They require considerable quantities of water to be pumped or gravity-fed from an adjacent waterway usually rivers or stream environment, passed through the earthen ponds, tanks or raceways and then discharged back into the source environment with little or no treatment.
<br>
<h2>Requirements for Fish Pond Site Selection and Construction</h2>

<h4>i. Homestead Fish Pond:</h4>
 For homestead fish culture, the house backyard is suitable. Earthen/Concrete pond can be used for this purpose. Soil at site of the earthen pond should be able to retain water.

<h4>ii. Commercial Fish Farm:</h4>
 In commercial fish farming, the first requirement is the choice of a suitable land for the establishment of the farm. Such a land must be sited near water with adequate topography for pond construction. The water source can be river/stream, spring, well or borehole. The water must be free from pollutants. Water is the medium for culturing fish; as a result the supply of water must be guaranteed throughout the culture period. The topography of the land should not be too hilly or too flat. A slightly depressed marshy land that can retain water for a long time is ideal for pond construction.Soils that are too porous or too clayey are not good for fish culture. In sandy soils, the water retention capacity is very low, while a soil that has very high proportion of clay (above 40% composition) will make the pond turbid (concentration of suspended solids) for fish. A suitable soil is that which has a good proportion of clay and loam (i.e. 40%: 60%)

<h4>iii. Land Survey and Fish Farm Design</h4>

Once a suitable land has been acquired, a registered Surveyor should survey it and a topographic map produced to permit the design of fishponds and other structures. The design of a fish farm varies with the nature of the land. If the slope is gentle enough (a good valley of 1:2 slope) to permit channels of water from the stream or river into the farm, the construction of a storage reservoir may not be necessary. In most gently sloping valleys, channels may not be practicable hence it might be necessary to block the course of water in order to raise the water level to permit diversion into ponds lined along (parallel to) the course of the river or stream. Such a dam may not necessarily form a storage reservoir suitable for fish production because of the fast flowing nature of the river during the flood and the difficulty of screening off the fish.

<h4>iv. Hints on Pond Construction</h4>

After conducting a feasibility study and planning on the type and size of pond to build on the site selected, construction work can start. Depending on the nature of the surrounding land, the construction could be manual or mechanical. In marshy lands the use of heavy equipment is not advisable. This is due to the risks and difficulties of using such equipment in those kinds of terrain. Construction of a large farm may require the services of an aquaculture engineer or a technical expert from any fisheries institution.
<br>
<br>
The main parts of any fish pond to be constructed are the dam walls (dikes), the water inlet and outlet system. Pond dikes must be well compacted to prevent seepage. Concrete ponds are preferable in areas where the soil is too sandy for earthen ponds or enough land is not available or the pond is required within the living premises. Cost of construction of concrete ponds vary with the size of pond, location, availability and cost of labor, source of water and cost of inputs such as cements, sand, gravel, plastic pipes, solid blocks, etc.
