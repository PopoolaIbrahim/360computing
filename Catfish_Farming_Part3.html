<h2> Health Management and Bio-Security</h2>

<h4>i. Disease Management</h4>

Disease prevention is a top priority when it comes to maintaining a healthy stock. Good health starts with ensuring that only healthy and disease free fish are stocked into a clean environment. This often means carrying out health checks prior to stocking fish or shellfish onto the site using competent trained personnel. It also means buying fish from stock which have been certified as free from specific diseases. Bio-security is an important key to aquaculture success. As most aquaculture facilities rely on natural water sources-rivers, ponds, seas - it is difficult to achieve 100 per cent bio-security. However, it is important that effort is made to ensure that no pathogens are introduced into the farm from vehicles, visitors, staff, and equipment. If possible, incoming water should be treated for pathogens using ultra-violet radiation or ozone. This is usually only practically possible in hatcheries or land based recirculation systems where a relatively small volume of water is being treated. This is also the part of the production cycle where it is particularly important as juvenile fish and larval shellfish are particularly susceptible to disease.
<br>
<br>
Farm bio-security audits and risk-assessments should be made on a regular basis and appropriate control measures put in place at each risk point. Effective hygiene and disinfection procedures must be developed at each point ensuring that the appropriate disinfectant at the required concentration and contact time is being used. Appropriate hygienic protective clothing should be available for staff and visitors. Visitor control should include written assurance that they have not had any recent contact with other potentially infected animals. Appropriate predator and pest control must be in place as these can also present a biosecurity risk. All elements of the biosecurity programme must be adequately monitored and documented, e.g. replenishment of disinfectant foot baths on a regular basis.
<br>
<br>
A second tier of disease prevention is the use of vaccines to protect fish against specific pathogens. Many vaccines are now available against common bacterial and viral pathogens and are a vital tool in maintaining healthy stocks. Vaccines, however, should never be seen as an alternative to good management and appropriate biosecurity procedures. Only by ensuring optimum welfare, vaccination status and environment can the farmer ensure that his fish will be robust enough to defend themselves against pathogenic challenges. Breaking the pathogenic cycle where management procedures reduce the level of environmental pathogens is important. This includes never stocking more than one generation of fish/shellfish in the same environment this ensures that pathogens are not passed from one generation to another. Ensures that there is a break between harvesting and re-stocking the farm is also key, i.e. fallowing the site for a minimum time period to reduce the pathogenic reservoir in the environment or periodically moving the farm to different locations.
<br>
<h4>ii. Importance of Bio-security</h4>

 

Bio-security is the process of taking precautions to minimize the risk of introduction and spread of infectious organisms into or between populations. Bio-security is very important to aquaculture because it prevents or limits the introduction and spread of disease within or between aquatic animal production facilities and sites. Since very few effective treatments are available for most aquatic animal diseases, effective bio-security is the key to preventing these diseases.
<br>
<h4>iii. How infectious organisms are transmitted</h4>

 

Disease agents that infect aquatic animals are frequently spread between aquatic organisms in the environment, or equipment used to transfer animals from one holding unit or site to another. Some diseases can also be spread directly through the water by animals releasing the infectious agent or by sick animals dying. Known sources of aquatic animal infections include contaminated feed, equipment, untreated wastewater, fish bearing source waters, and pests such as birds or rodents.
<br>
<br>

Ways of reducing the risk of disease introduction or spread
<br>
<br>
Enforce strict sanitary measures for personnel, feed suppliers, veterinarians, harvesters and visitors. Provide disinfected protective clothing and hand and footwear disinfection stations at each entrance and exit.
<br>
<br>
Routinely disinfect equipment and water with recommended disinfectants. Ensure that the disinfectant can be applied safely and poses no toxic risk to humans, aquatic animals or the environment.
<br>
<br>
Restrict vehicle, boat and equipment contact with culture and holding units.
<br>
<br>

Maintain a log of all visitors coming in contact with your aquatic animals.
<br>
<br>
Plan the flow of personnel movement through the facility and require that personnel undertake disinfection procedures between holding units and/or buildings.
<br>
<br>
Contain and/or treat effluent and organic waste at origin and prohibit it from re-entering production areas. For open water facilities, dispose of organic waste on land at a site that has measures to prohibit escape of breakdown products into surrounding waters.
<br>
<br>
Use pest management protocols to keep out birds, vermin and/or predators.
<br>
<br>
Use signage at the facility to inform visitors and personnel that there are bio-security requirements in place such as controlled access, footbaths, video surveillance, etc.
<br>
<h4>iii.                How to keep fish in the pond healthy</h4>

a)       Choose your facility/site location carefully with bio-security in mind; considering, for example: hydrographical characteristics, accessibility for stock in - stock out movements, and health status of surrounding farmed or wild aquatic animals.
<br>
<br>
b)       Choose a safe water source for land-based facilities such as well water or spring water. Where such water sources are not available, use disinfectant and/or filtration system(s).
<br>
<br>
c)       Stock only with certified disease-free eggs and/or aquatic animals.
<br>
<br>
d)       Schedule routine disease monitoring with a veterinarian and implement an aquatic animal health management plan.
<br>
<br>
e)       Remove mortalities and moribund animals routinely. When disease is suspected, contact your veterinarian.
<br>
<br>
f)        Use caution prior to moving aquatic animals between holding units or farms. Aquatic animals showing signs of disease should not be sold or transferred to other facilities.
<br>
<br>
g)       Minimize handling wherever possible to reduce stress that can predispose aquatic animals to infectious diseases.
<br>
<h2> Daily Routine Husbandry Practices</h2>

The most important schedule for the farmer in his fish farm is to make sure the environment is good for the fish. Water is the major component of the environment. Therefore its quality for aquaculture enables successful propagation of fish. The most important water quality parameters the farmer needs to always check are:-
<br>

<h4>i.                    Dissolved Oxygen</h4>

Dissolve oxygen is the most critical and limiting factor in aquaculture. Oxygen enters water through photosynthesis by aquatic plants, principally phytoplankton, and by diffusion at the air-water interface. Oxygen is lost from the water through respiration by fish, phytoplankton and other organisms, and by aerobic decay of organic matters. The signs fish exhibit to how dissolve oxygen (D.O) include: loss of appetite, lethargy, gasping near the surface of the pond, fish facing into current of inlet or aeration death of larger fish, followed by smaller fish. The effects of low DO include: stress increased susceptibility to diseases, poor feed conversion efficiency, poor growth and death of fish and other aquatic organisms.

<h4>ii.                  pH</h4>

This is the measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in soil or water. An ion is an electrically charged atom. Water exists as a balance between hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxyl ions (OH-). The PH of pond water should be maintained between the optimum limits for fish that is 6.5-9.0 if the water is too acidic, lime should be applied and when it is too basic, fertilizer should be applied according to recommended dosage. When the PH is sub-optimal, there will be increase of mucus on gill surfaces damage to eye lens and cornea, abnormal swimming behavior, fin ray, poor phytoplankton and zooplankton and death. The effect of sub-optimal PH include: stress, increased susceptibility to disease, low production levels and poor growth.

<h4>iii.                               Temperature</h4>

Aquaculture organisms are cold blooded animals. They can modify their body temperature to the environment in normal condition, unlike the warm-blood animals, which can react to maintain the optimum range of temperature. For example, the optimum range of temperature for the black tiger head shrimp is between 280c-300c. Increase in temperature beyond 300c increase the activity level and the metabolism. This also increases the growth rate. If the temperature still increases then the shrimp reacts a threshold of physical and nutritional tolerance, which is 330c in poor quality H20 or 350c in good quality water and remains stationary at the pond bottom.
<br>
<br>
b)       Others include Salinity, Ammonia, Turbidity, Algal Bloom and Nitrite
<br>
<br>
Some indicators of bad quality of water are:
<br>
<br>
a)      Offensive odour
<br>
<br>
b)      Thick, deep green, brownish or greyish colour of water
<br>
<br>
c)      Sluggish movement of fish
<br>
<br>
d)      Off- appetite and poor feed consumption
<br>
<br>
e)      Fish death
<br>
<br>
The first aid treatment is to flush out the water and replace it immediately. Water kit can be used to monitor Ph, dissolved oxygen, temperature etc. The walls of concrete, plastic, tarpaulin, metal and wooden tanks should be regularly cleaned of algal growth and food particles to avoid pollution and fish death.
<br>

<h2>Sanitation and Waste Management</h2>

Sanitation in fish ponds entails keeping the pond water and the environment clean. During routine pond water changes, waste water should be properly discharged the outlets to prevent environmental pollution. Pond water are rich in nutrients so they can be utilized for vegetable gardening, irrigation in integrated farms or otherwise filtered and recycled in some instances.
<br>
<br>
It is important to make sure all operation tools such as nets, containers, bags, and boots are clean before and after use in the farm. Management of tools implies keeping them appropriately in good condition and in a dry place at all times. Disinfectants are used after washing the tools for proper sanitation. Workers should be discouraged from entering fish ponds with fish stocks inside. Dead fish should be properly disposed and not thrown indiscriminately in the environment. Fish corpses should be buried or incinerated before burying.
