<h2>Safety Use and Handling of Pesticides</h2>

Using pesticides safely depends on many things. Some of the most important factors include selecting the appropriate product, and using that product according to the label directions. The label directions are written to minimize the risk of problems and to define the legal uses for the product.Make sure kids and pets are out of the area before mixing and applying pesticides.
<br>
<br>
Be sure to wear clothing that will protect you when using pesticides. Consider wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, and closed-toe shoes in addition to any other protective clothing or equipment required by the label.
<br>
<br>
1. Mix pesticides outdoors or in well-ventilated areas.
<br>
2. Mix only what you need to use in the short term to avoid storing or disposing of excess pesticide.
<br>
3. Be prepared for a pesticide spill. Have paper towels, sawdust or kitty litter, garbage bags, and non-absorbent gloves on hand to contain the spill. 
<br>
4. Avoid using excessive amounts of water, as this may only spread the pesticide and could be harmful to the environment.
<br>
5. Remove personal items, such as toys, clothing, or tools from the spray area to avoid contamination.
<br>
6. When applying pesticides as a spray or dust outside, avoid windy conditions and close the doors and windows to your home.
<br>
7.  After using pesticides, wash your hands before smoking or eating.
<br>

<h2>Crop Maturity Harvesting and Storage</h2>

Rice is ready for harvesting when the grains are hard and are turning yellow/brown (about 30 45 days after flowering). Harvest when 80 85% of the grains have turned straw colour to avoid shattering, this is usually about 4-5 weeks after at least 50% flowering. 
<br>
<br>
Cut the rice stems with a sickle at about 15-20cm above the ground to permit hand threshing. Tie the panicles in bundles. Then place the tied-up bundles of harvested rice crop in heaps for drying before threshing 80 percent of the paddy. 
<br>
<br>
Farmers' yields range between 1,200 and 3,000kg ha-1 (16-40 bags) for swamp rice and 1,000 - 1,500kg ha-1 (13-20 bags) for upland rice. With improved practices yields of up to 5,000 - 6,000 (about 73 bags) and 2,500- 3,000kg ha-1 (about 37 bags) of paddy are possible for swamp/lowland and upland rice, respectively. 
<br>
<br>
Rice paddy intended for storage should be properly dried. Rice paddy should be stored in a cool, dry and rodent proof condition. Clean the store (rumbu) before putting in your paddy. 
<br>
<br>
To protect the paddy against insect pests, use 1 match boxes full of Actellic 2.5 dust to about 25 kg of paddy. Infested paddy should be fumigated with phostoxin in air-tight containers at the rate of one tablet per jute bag (100 kg paddy) or 10-15 tablets per ton of paddy.
